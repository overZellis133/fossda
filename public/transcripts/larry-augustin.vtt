00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:08.047
<v Elisabetta Mori>It's the 16th of April 2024 and I

4
00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.481
<v Elisabetta Mori>am Elisabetta Mori, an historian
of computing currently based in

5
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:16.889
<v Elisabetta Mori>Italy and an oral history
interview with FOSSDA.

6
00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:20.296
<v Elisabetta Mori>Today I'll be talking to Larry
Augustin.

7
00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:26.032
<v Elisabetta Mori>Larry Augustin is an entrepreneur,
angel investor and advisor to

8
00:00:26.073 --> 00:00:27.235
<v Elisabetta Mori>technology companies.

9
00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.504
<v Elisabetta Mori>He He was the founder of VA

10
00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:33.393
<v Elisabetta Mori>Research that became VA Linux,
SourceForge.

11
00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:37.245
<v Elisabetta Mori>He was part of the team who who
coined the term Open Software.

12
00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:42.776
<v Elisabetta Mori>He was CEO of SugarCRM and the
Vice President for Applications

13
00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.563
<v Elisabetta Mori>and and Web Services.

14
00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Elisabetta Mori>We are recording on the story.io

15
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:53.765
<v Elisabetta Mori>and I am in Livorno, Tuscany,
Italy, and Larry is in his home in

16
00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:55.147
<v Elisabetta Mori>Los Altos, California.

17
00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.975
<v Elisabetta Mori>So thank you and welcome, Larry.

18
00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:01.306
<v Larry Augustin>Thank you, Elisabetta.

19
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.189
<v Larry Augustin>Happy to be here.

20
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:03.874
<v Larry Augustin>Happy to do this.

21
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:07.388
<v Elisabetta Mori>Yeah, so let's start from the

22
00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:07.789
<v Elisabetta Mori>beginning.

23
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.895
<v Elisabetta Mori>So where and when were you born?

24
00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:19.914
<v Larry Augustin>Oh, I was born 1962 in Dayton,
Ohio, the middle of the country in

25
00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:20.535
<v Larry Augustin>the US.

26
00:01:21.376 --> 00:01:24.986
<v Larry Augustin>My father was in the Air Force and

27
00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:29.135
<v Larry Augustin>we had settled in Dayton and ended
up growing up there.

28
00:01:30.803 --> 00:01:35.472
<v Larry Augustin>My mother's side of the family
were farmers and had a farm in the

29
00:01:35.673 --> 00:01:37.901
<v Larry Augustin>east coast of the US, New
Hampshire.

30
00:01:38.963 --> 00:01:41.168
<v Larry Augustin>And I spent a lot of times there.

31
00:01:41.228 --> 00:01:43.252
<v Larry Augustin>In fact, if you look at sort of my

32
00:01:43.573 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Larry Augustin>early life, the time I spent in
summers working on the farm was

33
00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:52.395
<v Larry Augustin>part of what helped me become an
engineer.

34
00:01:53.202 --> 00:01:56.149
<v Larry Augustin>My dad was an electrical engineer
and so I sort of followed in his

35
00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.691
<v Larry Augustin>footsteps.

36
00:01:57.172 --> 00:01:58.782
<v Larry Augustin>That was my, you know, sort of

37
00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:01.932
<v Larry Augustin>goal a whole life was to follow in
his footsteps and also be an

38
00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:02.761
<v Larry Augustin>electrical engineer.

39
00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:05.867
<v Larry Augustin>But I spent the summers working on

40
00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:11.683
<v Larry Augustin>the family farm in New Hampshire,
you know, baling hay, doing, you

41
00:02:12.024 --> 00:02:14.107
<v Larry Augustin>know, everything around the place.

42
00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:19.116
<v Larry Augustin>And I developed this tendency to

43
00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:20.121
<v Larry Augustin>just fix things.

44
00:02:21.104 --> 00:02:22.267
<v Larry Augustin>It's part of what drove me to be

45
00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:22.848
<v Larry Augustin>an engineer.

46
00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:25.515
<v Larry Augustin>I often say, when you're out in

47
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.967
<v Larry Augustin>the field and the tractor breaks,
there's nobody to call.

48
00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:31.203
<v Larry Augustin>You know, we didn't have cell
phones, there was no one there.

49
00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:33.389
<v Larry Augustin>You had to just fix things
yourself.

50
00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:37.804
<v Larry Augustin>And so my whole life, that's how I
kind of approach things, which is

51
00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Larry Augustin>just learn to do whatever needs to
be done and be hands-on and fix

52
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.501
<v Larry Augustin>things.

53
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:47.585
<v Larry Augustin>And what about your mom?

54
00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.609
<v Larry Augustin>What did she do?
My mom is a nurse.

55
00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:59.627
<v Larry Augustin>She grew up on the farm and then
she was able to go to nursing

56
00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:03.895
<v Larry Augustin>school and she became a nurse.

57
00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:08.228
<v Larry Augustin>And then, you know, after I came

58
00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.375
<v Larry Augustin>along, she retired from that and
was a full-time mom.

59
00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:17.174
<v Elisabetta Mori>And who were the important
influences on you in your early

60
00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:20.064
<v Elisabetta Mori>life?
Oh, great question.

61
00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:24.212
<v Larry Augustin>You know, obviously my parents.

62
00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:26.716
<v Larry Augustin>I mean, I had just huge respects

63
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.247
<v Larry Augustin>there, wanting to follow in the
footsteps of my dad in many ways.

64
00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:40.889
<v Larry Augustin>But early on in life, I would say
I was lucky to have great teachers

65
00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:47.905
<v Larry Augustin>early in school, grade school and
elementary, who really, I guess,

66
00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:56.885
<v Larry Augustin>influenced me in the value of
education, but in all sorts of

67
00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:01.094
<v Larry Augustin>different disciplines, whether it
was mathematics or science.

68
00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:04.425
<v Larry Augustin>And, you know, I was lucky to have
great teachers who helped me

69
00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:04.706
<v Larry Augustin>there.

70
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.234
<v Larry Augustin>And, you know, some of that

71
00:04:08.274 --> 00:04:09.221
<v Larry Augustin>certainly by random.

72
00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:11.584
<v Larry Augustin>I was lucky.

73
00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:19.736
<v Larry Augustin>And I was also lucky in that
Dayton, Ohio, is home to something

74
00:04:19.796 --> 00:04:23.927
<v Larry Augustin>called the Ham Fest, which I don't
know if a lot of people know, but

75
00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:31.286
<v Larry Augustin>it is a gathering of ham radio
operators that happens every year.

76
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.260
<v Larry Augustin>But beyond that sort of just ham
radio operators, it's really about

77
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:39.745
<v Larry Augustin>people who tinker with
electronics.

78
00:04:40.888 --> 00:04:45.221
<v Larry Augustin>And so I was lucky to have this
exposure early on that this

79
00:04:45.481 --> 00:04:48.989
<v Larry Augustin>interesting thing was happening
and I wanted to learn.

80
00:04:50.332 --> 00:04:56.708
<v Larry Augustin>And so I was a kid who always was
experimenting with sort of basic

81
00:04:56.768 --> 00:04:57.549
<v Larry Augustin>electronics.

82
00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:00.334
<v Larry Augustin>I had the little kits as a kid

83
00:05:00.354 --> 00:05:06.270
<v Larry Augustin>where you would build the radio
from scratch or you would wire

84
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.034
<v Larry Augustin>together a little electronic
circuits.

85
00:05:08.094 --> 00:05:12.011
<v Larry Augustin>And I was always kind of tinkering
or doing or building something

86
00:05:12.051 --> 00:05:12.392
<v Larry Augustin>like that.

87
00:05:14.183 --> 00:05:15.566
<v Elisabetta Mori>Which schools did you attend?

88
00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:20.656
<v Elisabetta Mori>And is there any, you know, an
event or episode that shaped you?

89
00:05:22.183 --> 00:05:23.165
<v Larry Augustin>Oh, wow.

90
00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:27.072
<v Larry Augustin>So, you know, I went through the

91
00:05:27.172 --> 00:05:31.927
<v Larry Augustin>sort of public school system
growing up in Ohio.

92
00:05:32.408 --> 00:05:34.774
<v Larry Augustin>I went to high school, a little
place called Stebbins High School.

93
00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:40.334
<v Larry Augustin>I'm not sure I would say Stebbins
is famous for just about anything.

94
00:05:42.402 --> 00:05:46.668
<v Larry Augustin>It was just a great place to grow
up and be a kid.

95
00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:55.505
<v Larry Augustin>And from there, my mother had
always had this dream that I grew

96
00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:59.613
<v Larry Augustin>up Catholic and my family was
Catholic and that her son should

97
00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:01.542
<v Larry Augustin>go to the University of Notre
Dame.

98
00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:05.369
<v Larry Augustin>And I applied.

99
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.113
<v Larry Augustin>And to be honest, to this day, I'm

100
00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:08.015
<v Larry Augustin>not sure how I got in.

101
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.564
<v Larry Augustin>I was a good student, not the

102
00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:13.069
<v Larry Augustin>best, but a good student.

103
00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.083
<v Larry Augustin>And if I look today, you know, the

104
00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:21.911
<v Larry Augustin>students that apply to
universities today are absolutely

105
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:22.492
<v Larry Augustin>amazing.

106
00:06:22.513 --> 00:06:22.994
<v Larry Augustin>I don't know.

107
00:06:23.294 --> 00:06:25.563
<v Larry Augustin>I was far from absolutely amazing.

108
00:06:27.106 --> 00:06:28.729
<v Larry Augustin>And I got in.

109
00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:32.176
<v Larry Augustin>So I ended up going to college at
Notre Dame.

110
00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:38.309
<v Elisabetta Mori>And what was the subject?
Oh, that's where I followed my

111
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.315
<v Larry Augustin>dad's footsteps and I went into
electrical engineering.

112
00:06:42.163 --> 00:06:48.533
<v Larry Augustin>And that's really where I sort of
spent my first time, sort of more

113
00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:50.036
<v Larry Augustin>hands-on with computers.

114
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.388
<v Larry Augustin>There was one thing in my high

115
00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:53.492
<v Larry Augustin>school that was interesting.

116
00:06:55.264 --> 00:06:57.208
<v Larry Augustin>There was a course I took as I

117
00:06:57.248 --> 00:07:00.375
<v Larry Augustin>began to try and understand
electronics and computers, but

118
00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Larry Augustin>more a course at this time.

119
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.694
<v Larry Augustin>And gosh, you look back and you

120
00:07:06.734 --> 00:07:10.107
<v Larry Augustin>realize how far the world has
come.

121
00:07:10.508 --> 00:07:15.604
<v Larry Augustin>That my first sort of exposure to
doing anything with programming

122
00:07:15.664 --> 00:07:17.688
<v Larry Augustin>was punched cards with cobalt.

123
00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:22.803
<v Larry Augustin>And as a high school student, I

124
00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:27.775
<v Larry Augustin>was able to take a course where we
didn't even have a punch card

125
00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:28.116
<v Larry Augustin>machine.

126
00:07:28.602 --> 00:07:31.909
<v Larry Augustin>We had these big coding forms, big

127
00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:37.404
<v Larry Augustin>ledger sheets of paper, 11 by 17
pieces of paper with lines on

128
00:07:37.444 --> 00:07:37.584
<v Larry Augustin>them.

129
00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Larry Augustin>And there were 80 columns on a

130
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:41.652
<v Larry Augustin>punch card.

131
00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:45.664
<v Larry Augustin>And you literally wrote in clean

132
00:07:45.804 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Larry Augustin>print across these sheets of
paper.

133
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.293
<v Larry Augustin>And we would send them in.

134
00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:54.001
<v Larry Augustin>So I'd have to write my program

135
00:07:54.142 --> 00:07:57.488
<v Larry Augustin>out by hand on a piece of paper.

136
00:07:57.528 --> 00:07:59.812
<v Larry Augustin>You'd send it in.

137
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.664
<v Larry Augustin>People would punch those into the
punch card machines.

138
00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:06.612
<v Larry Augustin>You would get back decks of cards.

139
00:08:06.712 --> 00:08:09.965
<v Larry Augustin>And then you sorted the cards into

140
00:08:10.106 --> 00:08:10.847
<v Larry Augustin>a program.

141
00:08:10.887 --> 00:08:13.574
<v Larry Augustin>And then you sent the cards in to

142
00:08:13.654 --> 00:08:13.855
<v Larry Augustin>run.

143
00:08:15.142 --> 00:08:19.050
<v Larry Augustin>So we think today about fast turn

144
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.616
<v Larry Augustin>and programming and developing
code.

145
00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:29.314
<v Larry Augustin>The productivity in that sense of
lines of code was pretty low.

146
00:08:29.334 --> 00:08:33.626
<v Larry Augustin>It was, you know, you spent a day
writing forms.

147
00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.631
<v Larry Augustin>You sent it in.

148
00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:37.315
<v Larry Augustin>You got punched cards back.

149
00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:40.684
<v Larry Augustin>I mean, it took a week to turn
around.

150
00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:47.321
<v Larry Augustin>And if you made one change, a
comma in a different place, one

151
00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:52.170
<v Larry Augustin>different line, it was a week to
make a minor change.

152
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.054
<v Larry Augustin>So you had to get that right.

153
00:08:56.841 --> 00:08:59.387
<v Larry Augustin>You had to make sure that was sort

154
00:08:59.487 --> 00:09:03.075
<v Larry Augustin>of perfect when it went in because
the turnaround was very slow.

155
00:09:05.424 --> 00:09:08.549
<v Larry Augustin>Then when I got to college, we
began to discover real

156
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.316
<v Larry Augustin>programmable machines,
microcontrollers.

157
00:09:15.403 --> 00:09:20.751
<v Larry Augustin>At the time, there were new
machines like the TRS-80.

158
00:09:22.234 --> 00:09:26.465
<v Larry Augustin>And eventually by the time I
graduated, the IBM PC and the

159
00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:28.329
<v Larry Augustin>Apple machines had come out.

160
00:09:29.632 --> 00:09:31.035
<v Larry Augustin>But that was my earliest exposure,

161
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.587
<v Larry Augustin>was writing COBOL programs, long
form.

162
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.313
<v Elisabetta Mori>So you go to Notre Dame, 1980,
1984.

163
00:09:41.721 --> 00:09:47.875
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then in 1984, you get the
fellowship from Bell Labs to go.

164
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.220
<v Larry Augustin>Yes.

165
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.308
<v Larry Augustin>So Notre Dame was a great, great

166
00:09:52.348 --> 00:09:52.809
<v Larry Augustin>place to me.

167
00:09:52.849 --> 00:09:55.174
<v Larry Augustin>I had an opportunity to experience

168
00:09:55.214 --> 00:10:03.888
<v Larry Augustin>a lot of different opportunities,
ranging from sort of those initial

169
00:10:04.049 --> 00:10:07.255
<v Larry Augustin>exposures to real sort of
programmable machines,

170
00:10:10.064 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Larry Augustin>microcontrollers, learning that.

171
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.935
<v Larry Augustin>I was lucky enough to be part of a

172
00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:19.948
<v Larry Augustin>group that created the first
personal computer lab there for

173
00:10:19.968 --> 00:10:21.871
<v Larry Augustin>the grant from IBM.

174
00:10:23.514 --> 00:10:25.180
<v Larry Augustin>I was lucky enough to be able to

175
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:35.892
<v Larry Augustin>work on a, we took an IBM PC and
modified it to run IBM 370 code.

176
00:10:35.912 --> 00:10:45.432
<v Larry Augustin>So IBM 370 being being the sort of
de facto standard of large scale

177
00:10:45.472 --> 00:10:46.975
<v Larry Augustin>computing from the mainframe
world.

178
00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:52.914
<v Larry Augustin>This was a time when there were
these two, I would say two worlds

179
00:10:52.954 --> 00:10:55.923
<v Larry Augustin>of computing that were colliding.

180
00:10:56.184 --> 00:11:00.991
<v Larry Augustin>The world of the, maybe that COBOL

181
00:11:01.031 --> 00:11:08.145
<v Larry Augustin>world, if you will, big mainframe
machines, a slow turnaround,

182
00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:14.456
<v Larry Augustin>hugely powerful, but you could see
the microprocessor world coming.

183
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.727
<v Larry Augustin>You know, we had the 8080, we had
the IBM PC.

184
00:11:18.508 --> 00:11:23.603
<v Larry Augustin>And I was lucky enough to be part
of a project that re-micro-coded

185
00:11:23.844 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Larry Augustin>the mineral to 68,000.

186
00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:28.352
<v Larry Augustin>My part was working on a cache

187
00:11:28.433 --> 00:11:38.972
<v Larry Augustin>memory system, and we built the
first IBM 370 inside a IBM PC.

188
00:11:38.992 --> 00:11:43.358
<v Larry Augustin>So I had an opportunity to work on
some really, really great

189
00:11:44.463 --> 00:11:46.146
<v Larry Augustin>computing things there.

190
00:11:46.346 --> 00:11:50.693
<v Larry Augustin>And then following, as I graduated

191
00:11:50.713 --> 00:11:57.146
<v Larry Augustin>there, Bell Labs had this
fantastic program where they would

192
00:11:58.949 --> 00:12:02.515
<v Larry Augustin>recruit students out of college
with no experience.

193
00:12:03.717 --> 00:12:05.505
<v Larry Augustin>And it's interesting, I
interesting, I watch today,

194
00:12:06.087 --> 00:12:10.216
<v Larry Augustin>students coming out of college and
some of these programs don't exist

195
00:12:10.297 --> 00:12:10.637
<v Larry Augustin>anymore.

196
00:12:10.637 --> 00:12:10.657
<v Larry Augustin>I anymore.

197
00:12:10.657 --> 00:12:13.847
<v Larry Augustin>I think we need more of those.

198
00:12:14.188 --> 00:12:16.512
<v Larry Augustin>I think I was a beneficiary of

199
00:12:16.593 --> 00:12:20.202
<v Larry Augustin>companies that did those things
when did those things when I

200
00:12:20.242 --> 00:12:20.923
<v Larry Augustin>graduated.

201
00:12:23.708 --> 00:12:25.971
<v Larry Augustin>They would recruit students out of

202
00:12:26.031 --> 00:12:30.081
<v Larry Augustin>college and to work at Bell Labs
at the time, you had to have a

203
00:12:30.121 --> 00:12:31.584
<v Larry Augustin>minimum of a master's degree.

204
00:12:32.727 --> 00:12:34.029
<v Larry Augustin>I didn't have a master's degree,

205
00:12:35.272 --> 00:12:40.268
<v Larry Augustin>but they also had identified that
there weren't enough people with

206
00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:41.230
<v Larry Augustin>master's degrees.

207
00:12:41.892 --> 00:12:43.721
<v Larry Augustin>And so they would recruit kids

208
00:12:44.503 --> 00:12:48.593
<v Larry Augustin>right out of their undergraduate,
they would bring them in, they'd

209
00:12:48.613 --> 00:12:51.043
<v Larry Augustin>give them an opportunity to work
for a year, and then they would

210
00:12:51.084 --> 00:12:55.955
<v Larry Augustin>send them off to school to get
their master's, get advanced

211
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.480
<v Larry Augustin>degrees.

212
00:12:56.761 --> 00:12:58.604
<v Larry Augustin>Fabulous, fabulous program.

213
00:12:59.986 --> 00:13:03.192
<v Larry Augustin>I was lucky enough to get accepted
into that.

214
00:13:03.653 --> 00:13:11.049
<v Larry Augustin>And I went from South Bend,
Indiana, Notre Dame, to Holmdel,

215
00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:20.069
<v Larry Augustin>New Jersey, the home of the
transistor, and Bell Labs, the

216
00:13:20.129 --> 00:13:27.404
<v Larry Augustin>place where the Big Bang was
discovered, and I got an

217
00:13:27.524 --> 00:13:31.570
<v Larry Augustin>opportunity to just learn more.

218
00:13:32.071 --> 00:13:34.895
<v Larry Augustin>And as part of that program, they

219
00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:40.169
<v Larry Augustin>sent me to Stanford University to
get my master's degree in

220
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:41.151
<v Larry Augustin>electrical engineering.

221
00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:43.475
<v Larry Augustin>Think heavily, though, computing.

222
00:13:45.665 --> 00:13:48.774
<v Larry Augustin>Back then, computer science, by
the way, was kind of this...

223
00:13:50.706 --> 00:13:53.034
<v Larry Augustin>When I went to Notre Dame, there
was not a computer science

224
00:13:53.074 --> 00:13:54.945
<v Larry Augustin>department, put put it that way.

225
00:13:55.486 --> 00:13:56.930
<v Larry Augustin>It was electrical engineering, and

226
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.193
<v Larry Augustin>computing was an offshoot.

227
00:13:58.915 --> 00:14:01.026
<v Larry Augustin>So if you think about, in other

228
00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:03.913
<v Larry Augustin>places, the, you know, computer
science being an offshoot of

229
00:14:03.953 --> 00:14:11.814
<v Larry Augustin>mathematics, for example, those
were the years when those sorts of

230
00:14:11.874 --> 00:14:15.403
<v Larry Augustin>departments were new, in some
sense, thinking of computing as a

231
00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:16.064
<v Larry Augustin>separate thing.

232
00:14:18.388 --> 00:14:18.889
<v Larry Augustin>But I was...

233
00:14:18.909 --> 00:14:26.104
<v Larry Augustin>If you are a young, excited
engineer who loves building

234
00:14:26.184 --> 00:14:30.854
<v Larry Augustin>things, and loves electronics, and
is excited about what you've been

235
00:14:30.894 --> 00:14:35.607
<v Larry Augustin>able to do with computers, and you
get the opportunity to go to

236
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:45.605
<v Larry Augustin>Silicon Valley and Stanford in
1985, it's just a magical place,

237
00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:48.489
<v Larry Augustin>and you stay.

238
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:53.676
<v Larry Augustin>So I spent a couple of years in

239
00:14:53.716 --> 00:14:59.147
<v Larry Augustin>New Jersey with Bell Labs, Labs,
but ultimately, I was drawn back

240
00:14:59.288 --> 00:15:04.380
<v Larry Augustin>to, you know, that world of
computing in the early years, in

241
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.946
<v Larry Augustin>the mid-80s, in Silicon Valley.

242
00:15:08.887 --> 00:15:12.733
<v Larry Augustin>And after a year or two at Bell

243
00:15:12.753 --> 00:15:17.285
<v Larry Augustin>Labs, I ended up back at Stanford
for my PhD. So in 1987, you moved

244
00:15:18.848 --> 00:15:23.863
<v Elisabetta Mori>back to Stanford, and what was
your PhD about?

245
00:15:24.725 --> 00:15:26.048
<v Larry Augustin>Electrical engineering.

246
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.115
<v Larry Augustin>And I've stayed in that, although,

247
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:34.873
<v Larry Augustin>I will say, at this point, getting
a lot harder to distinguish what I

248
00:15:34.913 --> 00:15:36.200
<v Larry Augustin>was doing from computer science.

249
00:15:37.923 --> 00:15:42.231
<v Larry Augustin>It was a lot less electrical, and

250
00:15:42.271 --> 00:15:43.693
<v Larry Augustin>a lot more computer science.

251
00:15:44.775 --> 00:15:46.000
<v Larry Augustin>I did blend the two together.

252
00:15:47.142 --> 00:15:57.255
<v Larry Augustin>I worked on verifying, creating
ways to verify circuit designs.

253
00:15:58.156 --> 00:16:05.692
<v Larry Augustin>At the time, the world of
electronic design automation was

254
00:16:05.893 --> 00:16:09.746
<v Larry Augustin>new and exciting, and we were
developing software that helped

255
00:16:09.766 --> 00:16:11.973
<v Larry Augustin>people build electronics.

256
00:16:14.784 --> 00:16:16.528
<v Larry Augustin>There was this world that I spent

257
00:16:16.588 --> 00:16:20.235
<v Larry Augustin>much of my time there called
hardware description languages,

258
00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:21.522
<v Larry Augustin>HDLs.

259
00:16:21.823 --> 00:16:24.509
<v Larry Augustin>That is a programming language for

260
00:16:24.549 --> 00:16:27.355
<v Larry Augustin>describing circuits, circuit
design hardware.

261
00:16:28.602 --> 00:16:33.113
<v Larry Augustin>And I worked on verifying timing
properties of circuits described

262
00:16:33.153 --> 00:16:34.440
<v Larry Augustin>in hardware description languages.

263
00:16:37.224 --> 00:16:41.711
<v Larry Augustin>And that's where I ultimately

264
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:52.029
<v Larry Augustin>developed my thesis on validating,
both through simulation and formal

265
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:57.497
<v Larry Augustin>logic, that a circuit held certain
timing properties.

266
00:16:59.825 --> 00:17:04.374
<v Elisabetta Mori>And so, when did you get involved
with Linux?

267
00:17:05.236 --> 00:17:10.372
<v Elisabetta Mori>What was it?
One of the things that we did in

268
00:17:10.412 --> 00:17:14.044
<v Larry Augustin>those early days in electronic
design automation, most of the

269
00:17:14.084 --> 00:17:15.848
<v Larry Augustin>work was done at universities.

270
00:17:16.108 --> 00:17:19.775
<v Larry Augustin>So Stanford, we collaborated and

271
00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:24.830
<v Larry Augustin>used a lot of tools of tools that
were written by the University of

272
00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:26.494
<v Larry Augustin>California, Berkeley, UC Berkeley.

273
00:17:28.163 --> 00:17:29.946
<v Larry Augustin>All of that software was available

274
00:17:30.327 --> 00:17:35.276
<v Larry Augustin>for sharing on this thing, in
hindsight, the internet.

275
00:17:37.363 --> 00:17:44.974
<v Larry Augustin>But the internet at the time was a
collection mostly of universities

276
00:17:45.055 --> 00:17:49.210
<v Larry Augustin>and a few research labs that were
able to share and distribute

277
00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:49.692
<v Larry Augustin>software.

278
00:17:51.343 --> 00:17:53.367
<v Larry Augustin>And everything that I tended to

279
00:17:53.427 --> 00:17:58.256
<v Larry Augustin>work with was software that was
available for free.

280
00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:02.953
<v Larry Augustin>I mentioned earlier that I'm kind
of one of these people that just

281
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.672
<v Larry Augustin>dives in and sees things and wants
to fix things.

282
00:18:09.164 --> 00:18:15.696
<v Larry Augustin>I had ended up, for my research
group at Stanford, doing a lot of

283
00:18:15.956 --> 00:18:17.519
<v Larry Augustin>system administration work.

284
00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:19.728
<v Larry Augustin>Just, again, administration work.

285
00:18:19.728 --> 00:18:22.013
<v Larry Augustin>Just, again, I see things that
need to be done.

286
00:18:22.033 --> 00:18:24.299
<v Larry Augustin>I have a tendency to just kind of
dive in and do it.

287
00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:25.787
<v Larry Augustin>And I didn't of dive in and do it.

288
00:18:25.787 --> 00:18:26.770
<v Larry Augustin>And I didn't know anything about

289
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.514
<v Larry Augustin>the things at the time.

290
00:18:28.815 --> 00:18:30.179
<v Larry Augustin>I'd been lucky enough to spend my

291
00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:31.276
<v Larry Augustin>time at Bell Labs, been lucky
enough to spend my time at Bell

292
00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:34.855
<v Larry Augustin>Labs, where I had taken a few
courses in Unix, and I had the

293
00:18:34.915 --> 00:18:37.827
<v Larry Augustin>opportunity to dive in and really
to dive in and really play with

294
00:18:37.847 --> 00:18:39.230
<v Larry Augustin>some interesting Unix machines.

295
00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:43.179
<v Larry Augustin>But out at Stanford, we used, at

296
00:18:43.299 --> 00:18:43.549
<v Larry Augustin>the time, Sun workstations for
most of our work.

297
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.894
<v Larry Augustin>And whenever out at Stanford, we
used, at the time, Sun

298
00:18:43.894 --> 00:18:43.954
<v Larry Augustin>workstations for most of our work.

299
00:18:43.954 --> 00:18:44.605
<v Larry Augustin>And whenever we'd get a Sun

300
00:18:44.826 --> 00:18:56.496
<v Larry Augustin>workstation, one of the things
that I would help with and did was

301
00:18:56.796 --> 00:19:00.310
<v Larry Augustin>to take that machine and install
all the software that we used to

302
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.971
<v Larry Augustin>do our research.

303
00:19:02.295 --> 00:19:03.790
<v Larry Augustin>Primarily electronic design

304
00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.050
<v Larry Augustin>automation tools.

305
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.240
<v Larry Augustin>Many of, as I said, were developed

306
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.510
<v Larry Augustin>and just given away for free by
other universities.

307
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:16.090
<v Larry Augustin>I recall carrying around with me
at the time was a, you know, a

308
00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.050
<v Larry Augustin>hard disk drive.

309
00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:18.460
<v Larry Augustin>And now we would look at it as

310
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.340
<v Larry Augustin>kind of a little tiny USB thumb
drive.

311
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:26.290
<v Larry Augustin>But, you know, when I carried it
around, it was big and I would

312
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:31.920
<v Larry Augustin>plug that in and, and essentially
upload all of this free software

313
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Larry Augustin>onto this commercial machine.

314
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Larry Augustin>And it was because, it wasn't

315
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Larry Augustin>because we couldn't afford or get
any software we wanted.

316
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Larry Augustin>As a research team at Stanford, we
had access to to essentially

317
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.400
<v Larry Augustin>anything we wanted to access to
commercially.

318
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Larry Augustin>We could get that.

319
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.290
<v Larry Augustin>But the software that we used was

320
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:59.910
<v Larry Augustin>easier to work with, was better,
was available for free.

321
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:09.650
<v Larry Augustin>And that's where I really learned
that, that, uh, a community of

322
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:15.280
<v Larry Augustin>people working together with the
goal of producing great software

323
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.669
<v Larry Augustin>was often producing things that
were better than what was

324
00:20:17.689 --> 00:20:19.513
<v Larry Augustin>available commercially.

325
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.024
<v Larry Augustin>And so that's where I began to

326
00:20:23.084 --> 00:20:27.272
<v Larry Augustin>learn that I could see that
difference from early on.

327
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:36.669
<v Larry Augustin>For example, early on, we did much
of our work in C. And the Sun

328
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:46.868
<v Larry Augustin>machine always came with the C And
the Sun machine always came with

329
00:20:46.888 --> 00:20:47.709
<v Larry Augustin>the C compiler.

330
00:20:47.749 --> 00:20:50.094
<v Larry Augustin>C compiler was part of Unix.

331
00:20:51.921 --> 00:20:57.011
<v Larry Augustin>But Richard Stallman over at the
Free Software Foundation at MIT

332
00:20:57.211 --> 00:21:08.391
<v Larry Augustin>had started building a C compiler,
GNU C, which was vastly superior

333
00:21:09.433 --> 00:21:12.357
<v Larry Augustin>to what came with the machines
commercially.

334
00:21:12.861 --> 00:21:15.766
<v Larry Augustin>And so we would install it and use
that.

335
00:21:15.866 --> 00:21:21.782
<v Larry Augustin>And again, lucky enough to be at
Stanford, the gentleman in the

336
00:21:21.923 --> 00:21:26.054
<v Larry Augustin>office across the hall from me,
Michael Tiemann, was one of the

337
00:21:26.094 --> 00:21:30.646
<v Larry Augustin>core contributors to GNU C, in
particular C++.

338
00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:37.841
<v Larry Augustin>And we were lucky enough to be
able to sort of see that evolve

339
00:21:38.562 --> 00:21:43.712
<v Larry Augustin>and develop quickly and be
superior to what was available

340
00:21:44.293 --> 00:21:44.834
<v Larry Augustin>commercially.

341
00:21:45.135 --> 00:21:46.041
<v Larry Augustin>And so that's where I really

342
00:21:46.101 --> 00:21:47.163
<v Larry Augustin>learned that difference.

343
00:21:49.086 --> 00:21:51.050
<v Larry Augustin>From early on, though, all that

344
00:21:51.471 --> 00:21:58.608
<v Larry Augustin>work was done on these powerful
Sun workstations, which were

345
00:21:58.688 --> 00:21:59.289
<v Larry Augustin>expensive.

346
00:22:01.052 --> 00:22:03.076
<v Larry Augustin>And I had this dream of being able

347
00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:07.726
<v Larry Augustin>to use Unix and work from home.

348
00:22:09.729 --> 00:22:10.991
<v Larry Augustin>That would have been fantastic.

349
00:22:12.253 --> 00:22:15.160
<v Larry Augustin>So I began looking around at ways
to do that.

350
00:22:17.423 --> 00:22:22.851
<v Larry Augustin>And it turns out there were
several people that had begun

351
00:22:23.251 --> 00:22:29.604
<v Larry Augustin>releasing variants of Unix that
ran on the IBM PC.

352
00:22:29.784 --> 00:22:35.174
<v Larry Augustin>You're sort of at the time where
the Intel processors had reached

353
00:22:35.515 --> 00:22:41.069
<v Larry Augustin>the point with the release of the
386, where the processor was

354
00:22:41.169 --> 00:22:45.280
<v Larry Augustin>powerful enough to run a real Unix
virtual machine.

355
00:22:46.483 --> 00:22:51.111
<v Larry Augustin>And code from a variety of
sources, it was the core of Unix,

356
00:22:51.612 --> 00:22:53.235
<v Larry Augustin>had begun to be available.

357
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.804
<v Larry Augustin>And I had played around with some

358
00:22:54.844 --> 00:22:55.225
<v Larry Augustin>other things.

359
00:22:55.245 --> 00:22:56.791
<v Larry Augustin>There were some Unix variants that

360
00:22:56.851 --> 00:23:01.426
<v Larry Augustin>were commercially available, but
to be honest, they were slow and

361
00:23:01.447 --> 00:23:04.492
<v Larry Augustin>clunky.

362
00:23:05.113 --> 00:23:06.535
<v Larry Augustin>So I began trying ones off the

363
00:23:06.555 --> 00:23:09.884
<v Larry Augustin>internet, as I did with any
software.

364
00:23:11.225 --> 00:23:15.711
<v Larry Augustin>And I compared two systems at the
time.

365
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:23.946
<v Larry Augustin>So one was releases of the
Berkeley Unix system, VSD, that

366
00:23:24.347 --> 00:23:26.731
<v Larry Augustin>had been released for PC for the
386.

367
00:23:26.731 --> 00:23:34.207
<v Larry Augustin>And the other was the system that
this student in Finland, Linus

368
00:23:34.227 --> 00:23:38.875
<v Larry Augustin>Tormalds, had begun to put
together, and that various people

369
00:23:38.955 --> 00:23:41.624
<v Larry Augustin>had bundled up systems around it.

370
00:23:43.207 --> 00:23:45.332
<v Larry Augustin>And I remember downloading and

371
00:23:45.372 --> 00:23:51.847
<v Larry Augustin>installing my first version of
Linux Slackware.

372
00:23:53.269 --> 00:24:06.249
<v Larry Augustin>I want to say it took 40 to 50,
1.44 megabyte floppy disks to copy

373
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:10.855
<v Larry Augustin>and install a Linux distribution
at the time.

374
00:24:11.496 --> 00:24:19.552
<v Larry Augustin>And in hindsight, looking back, it
wasn't a very big system, but we

375
00:24:19.592 --> 00:24:22.481
<v Larry Augustin>weren't running around with a lot
of storage in space either.

376
00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:29.095
<v Larry Augustin>And managing your collection of
floppy disks was part of the

377
00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:29.536
<v Larry Augustin>challenge.

378
00:24:31.685 --> 00:24:32.627
<v Larry Augustin>But it was interesting.

379
00:24:32.647 --> 00:24:35.153
<v Larry Augustin>I had enough computer science
background.

380
00:24:35.173 --> 00:24:40.369
<v Larry Augustin>I had done in-depth operating
system understanding and work that

381
00:24:40.991 --> 00:24:44.663
<v Larry Augustin>I understood that the architecture
of the Berkeley system was, I

382
00:24:44.683 --> 00:24:50.920
<v Larry Augustin>don't know if the right word is
maybe a little bit cleaner, maybe

383
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.005
<v Larry Augustin>a little bit more formal, a little
bit more mature.

384
00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:59.743
<v Larry Augustin>However, Linus's system was
evolving much faster.

385
00:25:01.285 --> 00:25:04.630
<v Larry Augustin>And I played with both systems.

386
00:25:06.233 --> 00:25:08.657
<v Larry Augustin>The Linux machine was super fast.

387
00:25:10.403 --> 00:25:16.655
<v Larry Augustin>And I looked at the, at the time,
Usenet newsgroups was a big part

388
00:25:16.675 --> 00:25:17.601
<v Larry Augustin>of how people communicated.

389
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:19.787
<v Larry Augustin>I looked at the traffic and usage

390
00:25:20.229 --> 00:25:21.412
<v Larry Augustin>and the pace of development.

391
00:25:21.613 --> 00:25:24.906
<v Larry Augustin>And I said, you know, there are

392
00:25:25.307 --> 00:25:28.695
<v Larry Augustin>more sophisticated operating
system features that the Berkeley

393
00:25:29.501 --> 00:25:33.447
<v Larry Augustin>Unix has that Linux does not have
today.

394
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:39.877
<v Larry Augustin>But the pace of development, this
path is going to cross.

395
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Larry Augustin>And so I built a home workstation
running on a 386 PC running Linux

396
00:25:50.351 --> 00:26:00.208
<v Larry Augustin>and brought all of my software
over that I used that I had gotten

397
00:26:00.248 --> 00:26:04.902
<v Larry Augustin>off the internet and was now able
to pursue my research working from

398
00:26:04.962 --> 00:26:05.182
<v Larry Augustin>home.

399
00:26:08.869 --> 00:26:11.613
<v Larry Augustin>Other people saw what I had put

400
00:26:11.713 --> 00:26:12.194
<v Larry Augustin>together.

401
00:26:12.214 --> 00:26:14.302
<v Larry Augustin>I said, that is, that is really

402
00:26:14.422 --> 00:26:14.783
<v Larry Augustin>cool.

403
00:26:14.803 --> 00:26:16.126
<v Larry Augustin>I want one of those too.

404
00:26:16.146 --> 00:26:19.975
<v Larry Augustin>A business is born.

405
00:26:19.975 --> 00:26:23.285
<v Larry Augustin>I want I want to say this was, at

406
00:26:23.305 --> 00:26:27.353
<v Larry Augustin>this point, we have reached the
early 90s.

407
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:43.822
<v Larry Augustin>I think around 93 was when I
looked at this and said, this was

408
00:26:43.842 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Larry Augustin>shortly after I had finished my
PhD, I defended my thesis.

409
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:52.441
<v Larry Augustin>I was working as a research staff
at Stanford.

410
00:26:52.481 --> 00:26:55.786
<v Larry Augustin>And I realized I could have, as
one person characterized it to me

411
00:27:03.921 --> 00:27:06.024
<v Larry Augustin>as a lemonade stand as a kid.

412
00:27:06.045 --> 00:27:07.207
<v Larry Augustin>But I started a side business of

413
00:27:07.227 --> 00:27:15.804
<v Larry Augustin>selling people pre-configured
Linux workstations.

414
00:27:15.824 --> 00:27:28.367
<v Larry Augustin>And I went from sort of friends
and family to, there was this new

415
00:27:28.487 --> 00:27:32.719
<v Larry Augustin>thing that had developed on the
internet called the World Wide

416
00:27:32.739 --> 00:27:32.819
<v Larry Augustin>Web.

417
00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:32.889
<v Larry Augustin>You could create, there was a new

418
00:27:32.889 --> 00:27:32.939
<v Larry Augustin>called the World Wide Web.

419
00:27:32.939 --> 00:27:33.009
<v Larry Augustin>You could create, there was a new

420
00:27:33.009 --> 00:27:34.388
<v Larry Augustin>brand new thing called a web
browser.

421
00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.562
<v Larry Augustin>You could create a visual UI.

422
00:27:38.602 --> 00:27:41.146
<v Larry Augustin>By the way, this is all pre-CSS.

423
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.021
<v Larry Augustin>Pre-JavaScript.

424
00:27:49.101 --> 00:27:53.169
<v Larry Augustin>You had HTML with some basic

425
00:27:53.189 --> 00:27:54.070
<v Larry Augustin>structuring tags.

426
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:57.036
<v Larry Augustin>And I put up a web page.

427
00:27:57.036 --> 00:27:58.562
<v Larry Augustin>A web page, a web page offering
Linux workstations.

428
00:27:58.582 --> 00:27:59.363
<v Larry Augustin>And it was kind of odd.

429
00:27:59.383 --> 00:28:09.381
<v Larry Augustin>At this time, as I said, the web

430
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:09.882
<v Larry Augustin>was new.

431
00:28:11.466 --> 00:28:15.517
<v Larry Augustin>Intel had discovered the web and

432
00:28:15.557 --> 00:28:16.519
<v Larry Augustin>Intel had a website.

433
00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:16.579
<v Larry Augustin>And on their website, they listed

434
00:28:16.579 --> 00:28:16.965
<v Larry Augustin>other companies.

435
00:28:16.965 --> 00:28:17.025
<v Larry Augustin>web and Intel had a website.

436
00:28:17.025 --> 00:28:17.105
<v Larry Augustin>And on their website, they listed
other companies.

437
00:28:17.105 --> 00:28:23.265
<v Larry Augustin>They listed companies selling
Intel-based computers.

438
00:28:23.285 --> 00:28:24.708
<v Larry Augustin>And I think they had five
companies listed.

439
00:28:28.701 --> 00:28:32.772
<v Larry Augustin>And I think they had five
companies selling Intel-based

440
00:28:32.873 --> 00:28:33.414
<v Larry Augustin>computers.

441
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:35.984
<v Larry Augustin>And I think they had five

442
00:28:37.065 --> 00:28:43.916
<v Larry Augustin>companies listed on the Intel
website that were selling Intel

443
00:28:43.936 --> 00:28:46.324
<v Larry Augustin>computers, Intel-based computers
on the internet.

444
00:28:46.384 --> 00:28:50.934
<v Larry Augustin>They were Dell, Compaq, Gateway,
and me.

445
00:28:52.844 --> 00:28:54.128
<v Larry Augustin>And I think there was one other.

446
00:28:54.148 --> 00:28:56.034
<v Larry Augustin>I'm not sure who the other was.

447
00:28:58.363 --> 00:29:03.389
<v Larry Augustin>And talk about a surprise.

448
00:29:03.429 --> 00:29:04.571
<v Larry Augustin>Where does that come from?

449
00:29:07.775 --> 00:29:09.317
<v Larry Augustin>But I was in some excellent
company.

450
00:29:10.304 --> 00:29:14.271
<v Elisabetta Mori>What was the name of the website?
So that was VA Research.

451
00:29:14.862 --> 00:29:15.243
<v Larry Augustin>Okay.

452
00:29:15.624 --> 00:29:17.912
<v Larry Augustin>So that is when VA Research was

453
00:29:17.992 --> 00:29:18.253
<v Larry Augustin>born.

454
00:29:19.083 --> 00:29:20.630
<v Larry Augustin>That's when VA Research was born.

455
00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.605
<v Elisabetta Mori>And what's the name?
VA?

456
00:29:26.442 --> 00:29:27.664
<v Larry Augustin>Oh, oh, oh, oh.

457
00:29:27.704 --> 00:29:30.691
<v Larry Augustin>So I had started doing this with

458
00:29:30.771 --> 00:29:32.855
<v Larry Augustin>my co-worker and friend, James
Vera.

459
00:29:33.982 --> 00:29:38.232
<v Larry Augustin>And so we were trying to figure
out what do we call this as we put

460
00:29:38.252 --> 00:29:38.754
<v Larry Augustin>it up there.

461
00:29:38.814 --> 00:29:40.382
<v Larry Augustin>And James and I were having this

462
00:29:40.402 --> 00:29:41.184
<v Larry Augustin>conversation.

463
00:29:41.926 --> 00:29:45.073
<v Larry Augustin>And we were inspired by Hewlett

464
00:29:45.113 --> 00:29:50.249
<v Larry Augustin>and Packard in the garage in
Silicon Valley.

465
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:52.555
<v Larry Augustin>So we had Vera and Augustin.

466
00:29:54.345 --> 00:29:56.231
<v Larry Augustin>But in hindsight, probably a

467
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:57.074
<v Larry Augustin>terrible name.

468
00:30:00.224 --> 00:30:01.627
<v Larry Augustin>Everyone thinks the company was

469
00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:02.409
<v Larry Augustin>from Virginia.

470
00:30:02.429 --> 00:30:05.595
<v Larry Augustin>It was VA, the abbreviation.

471
00:30:06.603 --> 00:30:08.268
<v Larry Augustin>But that's what we ended up with.

472
00:30:09.271 --> 00:30:10.354
<v Larry Augustin>That's what we ended up with.

473
00:30:12.262 --> 00:30:18.791
<v Larry Augustin>And so we launched that business,
I want to say around 93, we began

474
00:30:18.811 --> 00:30:19.272
<v Larry Augustin>doing this.

475
00:30:29.924 --> 00:30:32.289
<v Larry Augustin>People would send us a check.

476
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.456
<v Larry Augustin>This is just an amazing way of
bootstrapping.

477
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.713
<v Larry Augustin>And to me, I always look for
today, I love the entrepreneurial

478
00:30:41.753 --> 00:30:45.426
<v Larry Augustin>part of the world and people
launching and building things.

479
00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:53.126
<v Larry Augustin>And we got people to send us
checks for the computers they

480
00:30:53.186 --> 00:30:57.655
<v Larry Augustin>wanted, because we were selling a
physical device.

481
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.708
<v Larry Augustin>And to me, these things were
hugely expensive.

482
00:31:01.768 --> 00:31:04.286
<v Larry Augustin>I mean, somewhere between $1,000
and $3,000.

483
00:31:07.283 --> 00:31:15.273
<v Larry Augustin>And I couldn't afford to buy the
parts to send someone.

484
00:31:16.334 --> 00:31:19.061
<v Larry Augustin>Well, a system that had been put
together.

485
00:31:20.102 --> 00:31:23.088
<v Larry Augustin>People sent us a check ahead of
time.

486
00:31:23.709 --> 00:31:29.042
<v Larry Augustin>We would cash the check, go buy
the parts, have an assembly party

487
00:31:29.083 --> 00:31:35.716
<v Larry Augustin>in the living room of my apartment
and ship them out.

488
00:31:37.423 --> 00:31:41.190
<v Larry Augustin>And that was what the business was
initially.

489
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:45.501
<v Larry Augustin>And then sometimes we would get a
little more sophisticated.

490
00:31:45.561 --> 00:31:51.554
<v Larry Augustin>We'd run up the bill on our credit
cards and get a little bit of a

491
00:31:51.594 --> 00:31:56.511
<v Larry Augustin>better deal on parts sometime, be
willing to buy ahead a little bit.

492
00:31:56.912 --> 00:31:58.797
<v Larry Augustin>But that's how we funded the
business.

493
00:31:58.797 --> 00:32:01.305
<v Larry Augustin>That's the business.

494
00:32:01.305 --> 00:32:02.327
<v Larry Augustin>That's how we funded the business.

495
00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:12.166
<v Larry Augustin>I had been doing some consulting
work for a company in the EDA

496
00:32:12.226 --> 00:32:19.957
<v Larry Augustin>space and struck a deal where I
was able to work out of that

497
00:32:20.077 --> 00:32:20.498
<v Larry Augustin>space.

498
00:32:23.222 --> 00:32:27.989
<v Larry Augustin>In Menlo Park and struck a deal

499
00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:34.397
<v Larry Augustin>there and began working that sort
of more full time.

500
00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:45.003
<v Elisabetta Mori>So how did the company evolve?
And so we went through.

501
00:32:45.023 --> 00:32:48.307
<v Larry Augustin>So I eventually decided I am
spending more time on this side

502
00:32:48.588 --> 00:33:02.951
<v Larry Augustin>hobby than I am doing my research
job at Stanford.

503
00:33:03.492 --> 00:33:08.204
<v Larry Augustin>So I decided it was time to dive
in and do that a full time.

504
00:33:09.728 --> 00:33:17.687
<v Larry Augustin>I was also inspired here by the
fact that it's kind of what you do

505
00:33:17.707 --> 00:33:21.355
<v Larry Augustin>around a place like Silicon Valley
and Stanford.

506
00:33:22.963 --> 00:33:27.292
<v Larry Augustin>You see other people doing this
and you see people diving into

507
00:33:27.332 --> 00:33:29.015
<v Larry Augustin>this full time.

508
00:33:30.582 --> 00:33:31.985
<v Larry Augustin>So I dove into it full time.

509
00:33:32.005 --> 00:33:33.628
<v Larry Augustin>I looked for help there.

510
00:33:33.728 --> 00:33:42.526
<v Larry Augustin>At one point, I had found a

511
00:33:42.586 --> 00:33:46.535
<v Larry Augustin>company I was partnering with
called Umax, a Taiwanese company.

512
00:33:50.644 --> 00:33:52.567
<v Larry Augustin>We worked out of Umax for a little
while.

513
00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:58.121
<v Larry Augustin>Just whatever we could do to sort
of fund and keep the business

514
00:33:58.181 --> 00:33:58.622
<v Larry Augustin>around.

515
00:34:02.487 --> 00:34:06.814
<v Larry Augustin>As I said, people would send us

516
00:34:06.874 --> 00:34:08.696
<v Larry Augustin>checks to fund the business.

517
00:34:08.795 --> 00:34:12.264
<v Larry Augustin>I got my first office, a little

518
00:34:12.304 --> 00:34:15.550
<v Larry Augustin>place called Pear Avenue in
Mountain View.

519
00:34:17.914 --> 00:34:23.985
<v Larry Augustin>Coincidentally, now the Microsoft
Silicon Valley building is where

520
00:34:24.045 --> 00:34:32.297
<v Larry Augustin>my office was in Mountain View
with VA Linux.

521
00:34:34.303 --> 00:34:39.754
<v Larry Augustin>There was a, again, I have no
idea, I have no idea sometimes why

522
00:34:39.793 --> 00:34:43.306
<v Larry Augustin>these things happen, but I was
lucky enough to find office space.

523
00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:47.101
<v Larry Augustin>To be honest, I don't know why
they were willing to sign a lease

524
00:34:47.222 --> 00:34:52.010
<v Larry Augustin>with a kid who was barely breaking
even.

525
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:58.464
<v Larry Augustin>I think it was a rental
foreclosure and I got an office

526
00:34:59.105 --> 00:35:01.989
<v Larry Augustin>and fired up the business for
real.

527
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:07.724
<v Larry Augustin>We ran hand to mouth, was the
business.

528
00:35:07.884 --> 00:35:13.363
<v Larry Augustin>Literally, a big part of the job
was how do you juggle checks

529
00:35:13.423 --> 00:35:18.194
<v Larry Augustin>coming in from customers so that
you could buy the parts to create

530
00:35:18.234 --> 00:35:22.246
<v Larry Augustin>the systems to send to those
customers, balancing that.

531
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:30.886
<v Larry Augustin>At the same time, I was very
active with the Linux groups on

532
00:35:30.906 --> 00:35:36.616
<v Larry Augustin>the internet, staying close to
that, watching the development of

533
00:35:36.676 --> 00:35:41.131
<v Larry Augustin>that, because all the software we
used was software that was coming

534
00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:42.114
<v Larry Augustin>off the internet for free.

535
00:35:43.643 --> 00:35:45.527
<v Larry Augustin>I really had this vision, if you

536
00:35:45.587 --> 00:35:45.908
<v Larry Augustin>will.

537
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:48.995
<v Larry Augustin>Dell had been very inspirational

538
00:35:49.035 --> 00:35:49.275
<v Larry Augustin>to me.

539
00:35:50.102 --> 00:35:52.168
<v Larry Augustin>If you look at the start of Dell

540
00:35:52.188 --> 00:35:57.906
<v Larry Augustin>Computers with Michael Dell and
his dorm room at, I think it was

541
00:35:58.006 --> 00:36:01.352
<v Larry Augustin>UT Austin, assembling PCs.

542
00:36:02.714 --> 00:36:04.301
<v Larry Augustin>I was doing the same, except I was

543
00:36:04.341 --> 00:36:06.768
<v Larry Augustin>doing it in the Unix world.

544
00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:13.405
<v Larry Augustin>If you look, Dell is effectively a

545
00:36:13.765 --> 00:36:15.368
<v Larry Augustin>logistics company in many ways.

546
00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:22.423
<v Larry Augustin>That is, they bring together a lot

547
00:36:22.563 --> 00:36:25.469
<v Larry Augustin>of components to create what they
create.

548
00:36:26.811 --> 00:36:30.264
<v Larry Augustin>We were doing the same, bringing
together components to assemble

549
00:36:30.284 --> 00:36:32.712
<v Larry Augustin>the hardware, but we were doing a
similar thing on the software

550
00:36:32.732 --> 00:36:32.973
<v Larry Augustin>side.

551
00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:36.646
<v Larry Augustin>I thought of what we were doing as

552
00:36:36.726 --> 00:36:42.421
<v Larry Augustin>extending the Dell model from not
just Dell for hardware, but Dell

553
00:36:42.461 --> 00:36:43.123
<v Larry Augustin>for software.

554
00:36:43.864 --> 00:36:47.252
<v Larry Augustin>That is, we are going to assemble,

555
00:36:47.412 --> 00:36:55.010
<v Larry Augustin>package, configure, maintain,
support the software side in a

556
00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.392
<v Larry Augustin>similar model.

557
00:36:56.653 --> 00:36:59.502
<v Larry Augustin>Our supply chain for software was

558
00:36:59.542 --> 00:37:00.003
<v Larry Augustin>the internet.

559
00:37:01.307 --> 00:37:03.612
<v Larry Augustin>At the time, it was all called

560
00:37:03.673 --> 00:37:04.455
<v Larry Augustin>free software.

561
00:37:08.423 --> 00:37:10.547
<v Larry Augustin>The business became about bringing

562
00:37:10.607 --> 00:37:15.316
<v Larry Augustin>the two of those together to
create a traditional Unix

563
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:22.190
<v Larry Augustin>workstation business in the line
of Sun, but where the hardware was

564
00:37:22.731 --> 00:37:27.463
<v Larry Augustin>open Intel technology hardware,
where we could bring together

565
00:37:27.523 --> 00:37:29.327
<v Larry Augustin>components from a variety of
places.

566
00:37:29.849 --> 00:37:33.423
<v Larry Augustin>The software was open free
software, where we could bring

567
00:37:33.463 --> 00:37:36.852
<v Larry Augustin>together software from a variety
of places.

568
00:37:36.892 --> 00:37:42.828
<v Larry Augustin>The combination of that was really
the vision and view of, at the

569
00:37:42.888 --> 00:37:43.990
<v Larry Augustin>time, VA research.

570
00:37:44.711 --> 00:37:47.676
<v Larry Augustin>We decided research was in the

571
00:37:47.696 --> 00:37:51.228
<v Larry Augustin>wrong connotation and Linux was
beginning to get some reference

572
00:37:51.288 --> 00:37:53.954
<v Larry Augustin>and brand name, and it became VA
Linux.

573
00:37:56.883 --> 00:38:06.015
<v Larry Augustin>As I was doing this, two of my
friends from Stanford had raised

574
00:38:06.436 --> 00:38:07.097
<v Larry Augustin>venture funding.

575
00:38:11.643 --> 00:38:14.387
<v Larry Augustin>Two gentlemen by the name of Jerry

576
00:38:14.407 --> 00:38:15.649
<v Larry Augustin>Yang and David Filo.

577
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:20.216
<v Larry Augustin>You may recall those names as

578
00:38:20.276 --> 00:38:24.527
<v Larry Augustin>their little company they had
started was Yahoo.

579
00:38:24.587 --> 00:38:31.366
<v Larry Augustin>Dave and Jerry were both PhD
students in EDA, Electronic Design

580
00:38:31.406 --> 00:38:33.611
<v Larry Augustin>Automation, at Stanford.

581
00:38:33.651 --> 00:38:34.713
<v Larry Augustin>They had started this little

582
00:38:34.753 --> 00:38:40.252
<v Larry Augustin>directory of the web on a machine
under their desk in their office

583
00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:40.854
<v Larry Augustin>at Stanford.

584
00:38:41.842 --> 00:38:47.453
<v Larry Augustin>And Dave, Jerry, and I, and there

585
00:38:47.493 --> 00:38:51.506
<v Larry Augustin>was a fourth person, David Koo,
had been considering ways that we

586
00:38:51.526 --> 00:38:55.015
<v Larry Augustin>could turn the things we were
doing into businesses.

587
00:38:57.284 --> 00:38:58.446
<v Larry Augustin>We looked at the internet.

588
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:01.873
<v Larry Augustin>We considered various ways you

589
00:39:01.913 --> 00:39:06.225
<v Larry Augustin>could turn the internet into
commerce, create a business.

590
00:39:06.245 --> 00:39:15.402
<v Larry Augustin>At the same time, I was doing this
Linux workstation idea.

591
00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:22.712
<v Larry Augustin>They were playing with this
directory of the internet, and

592
00:39:23.634 --> 00:39:31.066
<v Larry Augustin>they had gotten Sequoia Capital to
fund that.

593
00:39:32.888 --> 00:39:40.057
<v Larry Augustin>They said one day, said, Larry,
you ought to meet the guys up at

594
00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:46.232
<v Larry Augustin>Sequoia, gentlemen by the name of
Doug Leone, and see if there's a

595
00:39:46.292 --> 00:39:52.609
<v Larry Augustin>way you could take capital and
grow what you're doing.

596
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.774
<v Larry Augustin>I said, well, that sounds like a
great idea.

597
00:39:54.834 --> 00:40:00.169
<v Larry Augustin>We've been living hand to mouth,
trying to build this business, and

598
00:40:01.291 --> 00:40:06.005
<v Larry Augustin>all along trying to do interesting
things with the growth of Linux

599
00:40:06.085 --> 00:40:08.009
<v Larry Augustin>and development through software.

600
00:40:08.831 --> 00:40:10.374
<v Larry Augustin>They introduced me to Doug Leone

601
00:40:10.995 --> 00:40:12.062
<v Larry Augustin>over at Sequoia Capital.

602
00:40:12.463 --> 00:40:14.968
<v Larry Augustin>I went up to Sequoia, had my first

603
00:40:15.009 --> 00:40:15.289
<v Larry Augustin>pitch.

604
00:40:16.692 --> 00:40:18.280
<v Larry Augustin>In hindsight, I have no idea why

605
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.583
<v Larry Augustin>Doug continued to talk to me.

606
00:40:19.603 --> 00:40:23.091
<v Larry Augustin>He knew more about entrepreneurs

607
00:40:23.152 --> 00:40:24.615
<v Larry Augustin>than I knew about anything.

608
00:40:26.241 --> 00:40:32.969
<v Larry Augustin>And it was a fantastic first

609
00:40:33.029 --> 00:40:41.137
<v Larry Augustin>conversation, but all of their
checks said, oh, this Linux stuff,

610
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:41.961
<v Larry Augustin>I don't know.

611
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:43.924
<v Larry Augustin>It's kind of a toy.

612
00:40:46.308 --> 00:40:51.096
<v Larry Augustin>We really like you, Larry, but
we're not ready to invest

613
00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:51.681
<v Larry Augustin>something there.

614
00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:54.087
<v Larry Augustin>And I said, that's fine.

615
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:56.433
<v Larry Augustin>I didn't know anybody else.

616
00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:57.841
<v Larry Augustin>I knew nothing about venture

617
00:40:57.861 --> 00:40:58.362
<v Larry Augustin>capital.

618
00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.946
<v Larry Augustin>I really had no idea what I was

619
00:40:59.986 --> 00:41:00.267
<v Larry Augustin>doing.

620
00:41:02.592 --> 00:41:04.015
<v Larry Augustin>But every few months, I would send

621
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:12.415
<v Larry Augustin>Doug an email update with how the
business was going and what was

622
00:41:12.455 --> 00:41:13.540
<v Larry Augustin>happening in the world of Linux.

623
00:41:14.442 --> 00:41:15.724
<v Larry Augustin>And it was interesting because

624
00:41:15.744 --> 00:41:19.951
<v Larry Augustin>Doug is an incredibly smart
gentleman.

625
00:41:20.693 --> 00:41:25.405
<v Larry Augustin>And he did a little bit of the
same things when I looked at

626
00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:29.733
<v Larry Augustin>Berkeley Unix versus Linux.

627
00:41:29.814 --> 00:41:30.796
<v Larry Augustin>I ultimately made the decision

628
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.488
<v Larry Augustin>that the acceleration path of
Linux is higher.

629
00:41:34.508 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Larry Augustin>Doug had done certain kind of
asking and questions around.

630
00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:45.113
<v Larry Augustin>And he had kept hearing, no, Linux
is kind of a toy.

631
00:41:45.153 --> 00:41:46.956
<v Larry Augustin>But he was watching things
develop.

632
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.064
<v Larry Augustin>And I kept sending him updates.

633
00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:57.475
<v Larry Augustin>And Forbes magazine had figured

634
00:41:57.495 --> 00:41:57.896
<v Larry Augustin>this out.

635
00:41:57.956 --> 00:41:59.521
<v Larry Augustin>And they put Linus Torvalds on the

636
00:41:59.561 --> 00:42:01.564
<v Larry Augustin>cover.

637
00:42:03.247 --> 00:42:06.772
<v Larry Augustin>And it was kind of a pivotal

638
00:42:06.832 --> 00:42:08.455
<v Larry Augustin>moment.

639
00:42:08.715 --> 00:42:09.757
<v Larry Augustin>I had sent this to Doug.

640
00:42:10.801 --> 00:42:17.152
<v Larry Augustin>And Doug, and by the way, this was
also shortly after Red Hat

641
00:42:17.252 --> 00:42:22.824
<v Larry Augustin>Software and Bob Young had gotten
funded.

642
00:42:23.184 --> 00:42:30.095
<v Larry Augustin>Eric Trone, Bob Young, that whole
team, great, great people had

643
00:42:30.135 --> 00:42:30.776
<v Larry Augustin>gotten funded.

644
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.864
<v Larry Augustin>And Sequoia looked over.

645
00:42:32.964 --> 00:42:36.272
<v Larry Augustin>And I think it was literally
something to the phrase of, Larry,

646
00:42:38.462 --> 00:42:43.833
<v Larry Augustin>we don't quite know what's going
on here, but we need to do

647
00:42:43.893 --> 00:42:46.905
<v Larry Augustin>something in this Linux space
because something is happening

648
00:42:46.945 --> 00:42:47.166
<v Larry Augustin>there.

649
00:42:47.908 --> 00:42:49.293
<v Larry Augustin>And you're the only guy we know.

650
00:42:54.164 --> 00:43:00.155
<v Larry Augustin>Which, if you know Doug, is just a
fantastic endorsement, if you

651
00:43:00.195 --> 00:43:00.376
<v Larry Augustin>will.

652
00:43:03.124 --> 00:43:03.966
<v Larry Augustin>Incredible person.

653
00:43:04.046 --> 00:43:05.169
<v Larry Augustin>And they showed up.

654
00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:07.694
<v Larry Augustin>And I took the first outside

655
00:43:07.734 --> 00:43:08.175
<v Larry Augustin>investment.

656
00:43:10.222 --> 00:43:17.371
<v Larry Augustin>And at the same time, I was really

657
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:22.958
<v Larry Augustin>about advancing the state of the
world of free software and what

658
00:43:22.958 --> 00:43:23.843
<v Larry Augustin>you could and what you could do
with Linux.

659
00:43:26.027 --> 00:43:30.494
<v Larry Augustin>I had been tracking down contacts
at Intel for years.

660
00:43:31.476 --> 00:43:34.386
<v Larry Augustin>And Intel felt something was going
on there as well.

661
00:43:34.907 --> 00:43:42.285
<v Larry Augustin>So Intel joined the Series A to
invest in us with the idea that

662
00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:47.995
<v Larry Augustin>this could be a part of the market
in which they were not a major

663
00:43:48.055 --> 00:43:51.586
<v Larry Augustin>player, but now they could begin
to move into the server

664
00:43:51.867 --> 00:43:56.115
<v Larry Augustin>workstation world with Unix and
Linux.

665
00:43:57.021 --> 00:44:07.755
<v Larry Augustin>And so that effectively moved us
from a small business to, okay,

666
00:44:07.815 --> 00:44:10.000
<v Larry Augustin>now how do we build a big
business?

667
00:44:11.763 --> 00:44:12.644
<v Larry Augustin>That was a big step.

668
00:44:13.546 --> 00:44:14.427
<v Larry Augustin>That was a big step.

669
00:44:17.692 --> 00:44:23.947
<v Larry Augustin>I would be remiss to not point out
just, again, how lucky we were to

670
00:44:24.007 --> 00:44:27.595
<v Larry Augustin>be in the right place at the right
time with people around Silicon

671
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.787
<v Larry Augustin>Valley and the community of people
that was building the software.

672
00:44:35.794 --> 00:44:41.328
<v Larry Augustin>I hired a gentleman, Leonard
Zubkoff, as our CTO, who was one

673
00:44:41.388 --> 00:44:41.869
<v Larry Augustin>of the...

674
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:44.354
<v Larry Augustin>Leonard ultimately did the first

675
00:44:44.434 --> 00:44:49.048
<v Larry Augustin>multiprocessor kernel work
developing Linux.

676
00:44:49.289 --> 00:44:51.975
<v Larry Augustin>He did significant work on other
parts of the system.

677
00:44:55.385 --> 00:45:02.785
<v Larry Augustin>We were always contributing back
or looking for ways to be part of

678
00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:03.968
<v Larry Augustin>the help of that community.

679
00:45:04.348 --> 00:45:11.608
<v Larry Augustin>At one time, interestingly, much

680
00:45:11.628 --> 00:45:15.757
<v Larry Augustin>of the software that we developed
was built by Richard Stallman's

681
00:45:16.258 --> 00:45:16.800
<v Larry Augustin>Free Software Foundation.

682
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:16.863
<v Larry Augustin>At one time, the machine that was,

683
00:45:16.863 --> 00:45:16.913
<v Larry Augustin>Richard Stallman's Free Software
Foundation.

684
00:45:16.913 --> 00:45:18.786
<v Larry Augustin>At one time, the machine that was,
in fact, the machine on the

685
00:45:19.026 --> 00:45:26.442
<v Larry Augustin>internet distributing that
software on the internet

686
00:45:26.542 --> 00:45:30.510
<v Larry Augustin>distributing that software sat in
the back of our office.

687
00:45:32.273 --> 00:45:40.352
<v Larry Augustin>It was a MIT.edu internet address,
but the actual server was in the

688
00:45:40.412 --> 00:45:44.304
<v Larry Augustin>back of our office because we
donated that that to the Free

689
00:45:44.344 --> 00:45:47.331
<v Larry Augustin>Software Foundation to distribute
software.

690
00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:49.315
<v Larry Augustin>And you think today about the
cloud.

691
00:45:50.842 --> 00:46:01.776
<v Larry Augustin>In the late 90s, the cloud was a
smaller machine with just a lot of

692
00:46:01.816 --> 00:46:07.408
<v Larry Augustin>disk drives sitting under
somebody's desk in the back of an

693
00:46:07.508 --> 00:46:09.732
<v Larry Augustin>office in Mount V, if you will.

694
00:46:09.932 --> 00:46:12.036
<v Larry Augustin>And that was common in those days.

695
00:46:13.142 --> 00:46:19.774
<v Larry Augustin>So that began sort of the launch
of how do we turn this into a

696
00:46:19.835 --> 00:46:20.436
<v Larry Augustin>larger business.

697
00:46:22.466 --> 00:46:24.752
<v Elisabetta Mori>So what year was this when you

698
00:46:24.792 --> 00:46:25.254
<v Elisabetta Mori>finally...

699
00:46:25.254 --> 00:46:30.286
<v Larry Augustin>Uh, that was probably 1997.

700
00:46:30.286 --> 00:46:33.763
<v Larry Augustin>And we grew the business very
rapidly from that point.

701
00:46:33.783 --> 00:46:34.722
<v Larry Augustin>We went public in 99.

702
00:46:50.465 --> 00:46:54.011
<v Larry Augustin>So it was at most two years from

703
00:46:54.131 --> 00:46:55.453
<v Larry Augustin>first funding to IPO.

704
00:46:55.473 --> 00:46:58.278
<v Larry Augustin>And the world of Linux was just on

705
00:46:58.298 --> 00:46:58.388
<v Larry Augustin>fire then.

706
00:46:58.388 --> 00:46:58.441
<v Larry Augustin>I remember just on fire then.

707
00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:01.306
<v Larry Augustin>I remember we helped organize some
of the first large-scale Linux

708
00:47:01.346 --> 00:47:04.230
<v Larry Augustin>events in Silicon Valley.

709
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.962
<v Larry Augustin>At some point, you don't quite

710
00:47:10.543 --> 00:47:17.292
<v Larry Augustin>realize the scale of the internet
at the time, nowhere near what it

711
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.444
<v Larry Augustin>is today.

712
00:47:22.464 --> 00:47:24.589
<v Larry Augustin>And it wasn't always obvious how

713
00:47:24.629 --> 00:47:26.534
<v Larry Augustin>many people were out there.

714
00:47:26.554 --> 00:47:27.606
<v Larry Augustin>You could watch traffic on Usenet

715
00:47:27.606 --> 00:47:27.616
<v Larry Augustin>groups.

716
00:47:27.616 --> 00:47:27.721
<v Larry Augustin>We could traffic on Usenet groups.

717
00:47:27.721 --> 00:47:29.144
<v Larry Augustin>We could share code and contribute
to the community.

718
00:47:29.164 --> 00:47:35.603
<v Larry Augustin>And we were the first large
traffic on Usenet groups.

719
00:47:36.265 --> 00:47:37.828
<v Larry Augustin>We could share code and
contribute.

720
00:47:39.792 --> 00:47:41.941
<v Larry Augustin>But you didn't always quite
realize the scale.

721
00:47:43.243 --> 00:47:47.271
<v Larry Augustin>And we organized an event in
Silicon Valley called the Future

722
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:52.585
<v Larry Augustin>of Linux, where I was able to get
people from Intel and from

723
00:47:53.306 --> 00:47:54.248
<v Larry Augustin>different groups.

724
00:47:56.472 --> 00:47:57.915
<v Larry Augustin>Companies like Cisco would just

725
00:47:57.955 --> 00:48:02.989
<v Larry Augustin>give us the space because they
wanted to support local user

726
00:48:03.029 --> 00:48:03.350
<v Larry Augustin>groups.

727
00:48:04.192 --> 00:48:06.196
<v Larry Augustin>And we ran this event.

728
00:48:07.883 --> 00:48:09.446
<v Larry Augustin>We called it the Future of Linux.

729
00:48:09.466 --> 00:48:10.347
<v Larry Augustin>It was the first...

730
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:17.384
<v Larry Augustin>I'll say prior to that, the Linux
user group meeting was a dozen

731
00:48:17.444 --> 00:48:20.770
<v Larry Augustin>people in a fast food restaurant
in Silicon Valley.

732
00:48:22.253 --> 00:48:23.195
<v Larry Augustin>But we promoted this.

733
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:25.485
<v Larry Augustin>And we had over a thousand people

734
00:48:25.545 --> 00:48:27.670
<v Larry Augustin>show up, standing room only.

735
00:48:27.811 --> 00:48:29.300
<v Larry Augustin>We completely overwhelmed the

736
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:37.314
<v Larry Augustin>conference facilities that we had
been able to beg, borrow, and get

737
00:48:37.354 --> 00:48:37.895
<v Larry Augustin>donated.

738
00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:41.405
<v Larry Augustin>And again, that was another point

739
00:48:41.645 --> 00:48:49.042
<v Larry Augustin>at which people like Sequoia
Capital began to realize there's

740
00:48:49.082 --> 00:48:50.044
<v Larry Augustin>some momentum here.

741
00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:54.954
<v Larry Augustin>And the scale is bigger than you

742
00:48:54.974 --> 00:48:55.616
<v Larry Augustin>may realize.

743
00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:00.872
<v Larry Augustin>I think a lot of people point to

744
00:49:00.912 --> 00:49:04.966
<v Larry Augustin>that event as a turning point.

745
00:49:05.426 --> 00:49:07.810
<v Larry Augustin>And I'll say the recognition by

746
00:49:07.891 --> 00:49:13.784
<v Larry Augustin>many people around Silicon Valley
and that ecosystem that there was

747
00:49:13.945 --> 00:49:15.327
<v Larry Augustin>something here.

748
00:49:18.553 --> 00:49:19.755
<v Larry Augustin>I think it would be pretentious

749
00:49:19.775 --> 00:49:23.186
<v Larry Augustin>for anyone to say we knew what it
was in that sense.

750
00:49:23.748 --> 00:49:29.605
<v Larry Augustin>But just the number of people that
would come together, it was

751
00:49:29.645 --> 00:49:30.387
<v Larry Augustin>fantastic.

752
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:34.355
<v Larry Augustin>So there was an event like that.

753
00:49:38.186 --> 00:49:49.765
<v Larry Augustin>As this was developing, more and
more of us were I think struggling

754
00:49:49.806 --> 00:49:57.645
<v Larry Augustin>a little bit with a divide in the
community between why we were

755
00:49:57.706 --> 00:50:02.575
<v Larry Augustin>building software in an open model
like this on the internet.

756
00:50:04.824 --> 00:50:10.073
<v Larry Augustin>If you listen to my story, I was
using software that was freely

757
00:50:10.113 --> 00:50:11.576
<v Larry Augustin>available because it was better.

758
00:50:13.103 --> 00:50:14.646
<v Larry Augustin>To me, that was always the model.

759
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:19.742
<v Larry Augustin>I used the GNU C compiler because
it was better than the C compilers

760
00:50:19.762 --> 00:50:26.955
<v Larry Augustin>that came from Sun. The same was
similar for user interface tools.

761
00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Larry Augustin>Linux was a free operating system.

762
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:35.555
<v Larry Augustin>There were commercial Unix systems

763
00:50:35.575 --> 00:50:37.844
<v Larry Augustin>that were available, but the fact
is Linux were available, but the

764
00:50:37.844 --> 00:50:39.488
<v Larry Augustin>fact is Linux is better for the PC
than the commercial systems.

765
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:42.120
<v Larry Augustin>And that had always been my
philosophy.

766
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:44.125
<v Larry Augustin>This is a philosophy that's very
different from the Free Software

767
00:50:44.145 --> 00:50:50.022
<v Larry Augustin>Foundation and Richard Stallman's
motivation.

768
00:50:50.363 --> 00:50:55.883
<v Larry Augustin>It had been very, you know, driven
by the notion that software is

769
00:50:56.203 --> 00:50:58.529
<v Larry Augustin>something that should be freely
available to everyone.

770
00:51:03.225 --> 00:51:09.938
<v Larry Augustin>And he had developed the GNU model
and the GNU licensing model that

771
00:51:09.958 --> 00:51:10.889
<v Larry Augustin>was designed to encourage that.

772
00:51:10.889 --> 00:51:10.949
<v Larry Augustin>But this split was developing and

773
00:51:10.949 --> 00:51:11.059
<v Larry Augustin>was, I think, licensing model that
was designed to encourage that.

774
00:51:11.059 --> 00:51:11.564
<v Larry Augustin>But this split was developing and
was, I think, exacerbated by

775
00:51:11.584 --> 00:51:23.308
<v Larry Augustin>groups of us that had been
building businesses around free

776
00:51:23.328 --> 00:51:23.829
<v Larry Augustin>software.

777
00:51:25.071 --> 00:51:27.916
<v Larry Augustin>And if you look at the concept of

778
00:51:27.936 --> 00:51:35.073
<v Larry Augustin>I am selling you something that's
free, it's kind of an odd concept.

779
00:51:35.093 --> 00:51:37.738
<v Larry Augustin>It takes people a moment to get
their heads around this concept.

780
00:51:37.738 --> 00:51:37.858
<v Larry Augustin>And the people a moment to get
their heads around this concept.

781
00:51:37.858 --> 00:51:43.342
<v Larry Augustin>And the gentleman by the name of
Eric Raymond, just a great thought

782
00:51:43.362 --> 00:51:48.170
<v Larry Augustin>leader, Eric is, had written a
paper called The Cathedral and the

783
00:51:48.191 --> 00:51:55.486
<v Larry Augustin>Bazaar, where Eric described this
idea of software built in an open

784
00:51:55.506 --> 00:52:03.462
<v Larry Augustin>model, in an open way where
everyone could see what was

785
00:52:03.482 --> 00:52:05.626
<v Larry Augustin>happening, versus software built
in a closed way.

786
00:52:05.707 --> 00:52:11.385
<v Larry Augustin>And he had written a paper called
The Cathedral and the Bazaar,

787
00:52:11.486 --> 00:52:14.289
<v Larry Augustin>where Eric described this idea of
software built in a closed, you

788
00:52:14.289 --> 00:52:14.834
<v Larry Augustin>know, in his world, the cathedral
this idea of software built in a

789
00:52:14.834 --> 00:52:15.525
<v Larry Augustin>closed, you know, in his world,
the cathedral model.

790
00:52:16.367 --> 00:52:23.044
<v Larry Augustin>And this really resonated with me,
because I think Eric had finally

791
00:52:23.184 --> 00:52:27.435
<v Larry Augustin>captured what many of us had been
thinking or trying to understand.

792
00:52:28.822 --> 00:52:35.613
<v Larry Augustin>But as Eric is, he's just sort of
brilliant at coalescing ideas.

793
00:52:35.874 --> 00:52:38.723
<v Larry Augustin>He had written it down well and
articulated it well.

794
00:52:40.266 --> 00:52:42.651
<v Larry Augustin>And some of it came together for
me.

795
00:52:42.671 --> 00:52:45.441
<v Larry Augustin>I'll tell you a very small
anecdote here.

796
00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:56.615
<v Larry Augustin>When I was building VA Research
and then VA Linux, we were using,

797
00:52:57.576 --> 00:53:00.405
<v Larry Augustin>I had chosen QuickBooks as our
accounting software.

798
00:53:01.086 --> 00:53:05.461
<v Larry Augustin>At the time, QuickBooks was very
new, but still small business

799
00:53:06.063 --> 00:53:08.049
<v Larry Augustin>accounting software, you have to
have something.

800
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:09.714
<v Larry Augustin>I had chosen QuickBooks.

801
00:53:12.962 --> 00:53:15.746
<v Larry Augustin>I had found a bug in QuickBooks.

802
00:53:17.008 --> 00:53:25.903
<v Larry Augustin>And for the old time DOS
programmers and geeks, this bug

803
00:53:25.983 --> 00:53:28.488
<v Larry Augustin>was the system would crash when I
would try and print.

804
00:53:30.251 --> 00:53:36.648
<v Larry Augustin>And this happened because, this
happened whenever I tried to print

805
00:53:36.729 --> 00:53:39.475
<v Larry Augustin>to a network attached printer.

806
00:53:40.702 --> 00:53:42.908
<v Larry Augustin>And it turns out that network

807
00:53:43.128 --> 00:53:45.795
<v Larry Augustin>printers could have names longer
than 11 characters.

808
00:53:47.102 --> 00:53:53.233
<v Larry Augustin>And experimenting with this crash,
I discovered that if the name of

809
00:53:53.293 --> 00:53:55.883
<v Larry Augustin>the printer was 11 characters
left, everything worked.

810
00:53:56.806 --> 00:53:59.073
<v Larry Augustin>And if it was longer than 11
characters, it crashed.

811
00:54:00.522 --> 00:54:05.610
<v Larry Augustin>And if you are a developer, you
could see what was happening.

812
00:54:07.814 --> 00:54:10.643
<v Larry Augustin>There was a buffer of 11
characters, which by the way, is

813
00:54:10.723 --> 00:54:13.991
<v Larry Augustin>exactly the same number of
characters of a file name in DOS,

814
00:54:15.194 --> 00:54:16.322
<v Larry Augustin>which is where it came from.

815
00:54:16.342 --> 00:54:18.808
<v Larry Augustin>And printers were attached to file

816
00:54:18.849 --> 00:54:19.129
<v Larry Augustin>names.

817
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:21.114
<v Larry Augustin>So without being too technical

818
00:54:21.155 --> 00:54:27.595
<v Larry Augustin>here, someone had a piece of code
that had an 11 character buffer

819
00:54:27.636 --> 00:54:28.237
<v Larry Augustin>for the name.

820
00:54:28.838 --> 00:54:30.119
<v Larry Augustin>And when it was longer than 11

821
00:54:30.169 --> 00:54:33.159
<v Larry Augustin>characters, it ran off the end of
this and it crashed the program.

822
00:54:33.159 --> 00:54:34.447
<v Larry Augustin>I could it crashed the program.

823
00:54:34.447 --> 00:54:35.229
<v Larry Augustin>I could see this in my head.

824
00:54:35.249 --> 00:54:39.850
<v Larry Augustin>And I know this is not necessarily
a mission critical story, but I

825
00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:42.687
<v Larry Augustin>critical story, but I called up
into it.

826
00:54:43.228 --> 00:54:44.710
<v Larry Augustin>I called up tech support.

827
00:54:45.952 --> 00:54:48.255
<v Larry Augustin>I thought to myself, this is

828
00:54:48.396 --> 00:54:48.776
<v Larry Augustin>great.

829
00:54:49.738 --> 00:54:55.528
<v Larry Augustin>I can contribute can contribute

830
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.153
<v Larry Augustin>and tell them what to look for.

831
00:55:00.174 --> 00:55:02.056
<v Larry Augustin>I could not get any attention.

832
00:55:02.237 --> 00:55:03.621
<v Larry Augustin>I could not get anyone to care.

833
00:55:04.142 --> 00:55:07.608
<v Larry Augustin>I could crash their software very

834
00:55:07.809 --> 00:55:08.269
<v Larry Augustin>easily.

835
00:55:09.571 --> 00:55:13.543
<v Larry Augustin>And I could imagine the fix in my

836
00:55:13.583 --> 00:55:16.994
<v Larry Augustin>head as a programmer, and I could
not get anyone to care.

837
00:55:18.202 --> 00:55:24.495
<v Larry Augustin>And all I could think was, if I
had the source code, I could fix

838
00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:24.695
<v Larry Augustin>this.

839
00:55:26.162 --> 00:55:30.928
<v Larry Augustin>Now, to me, that little experience

840
00:55:31.509 --> 00:55:37.361
<v Larry Augustin>really crystallized what we had
been doing and what people like

841
00:55:37.481 --> 00:55:43.893
<v Larry Augustin>Eric had begun to write about,
which is this notion that you

842
00:55:43.974 --> 00:55:48.466
<v Larry Augustin>empower the person, the user, with
access.

843
00:55:48.506 --> 00:55:49.508
<v Larry Augustin>You enable them.

844
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.474
<v Larry Augustin>Whether I could have fixed that

845
00:55:52.574 --> 00:55:56.729
<v Larry Augustin>code in my case, you know, I like
to think I could have fixed the

846
00:55:56.769 --> 00:55:57.049
<v Larry Augustin>code.

847
00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:00.624
<v Larry Augustin>But if I had had access, maybe I

848
00:56:00.644 --> 00:56:02.287
<v Larry Augustin>could have hired someone to fix
the code.

849
00:56:03.269 --> 00:56:06.401
<v Larry Augustin>Or if it had been open, I could
have contributed a fix.

850
00:56:07.103 --> 00:56:10.051
<v Larry Augustin>But none of that was possible
because the software was built in

851
00:56:10.112 --> 00:56:14.048
<v Larry Augustin>a cathedral, and it was built in a
black box, and it was hidden, and

852
00:56:14.088 --> 00:56:16.715
<v Larry Augustin>there was nothing you could do
about that.

853
00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:30.255
<v Larry Augustin>And ultimately, Eric's book had
gotten the attention of Netscape

854
00:56:30.275 --> 00:56:34.365
<v Larry Augustin>Software and Mark Andreessen at
the time, and they had invited

855
00:56:34.465 --> 00:56:40.344
<v Larry Augustin>Eric to come out to Silicon
Valley, and I hosted Eric for a

856
00:56:40.404 --> 00:56:41.426
<v Larry Augustin>bit when he came out.

857
00:56:41.486 --> 00:56:45.174
<v Larry Augustin>He came by the office, and I don't

858
00:56:45.194 --> 00:56:49.448
<v Larry Augustin>think we had ever met face-to-face
before that.

859
00:56:50.049 --> 00:56:52.314
<v Larry Augustin>It's interesting, you know, many
of these relationships all

860
00:56:52.354 --> 00:56:53.341
<v Larry Augustin>developed online.

861
00:56:55.224 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Larry Augustin>And we convened a meeting at our

862
00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:04.542
<v Larry Augustin>offices in Mountain View where we
were discussing this, and Eric was

863
00:57:04.642 --> 00:57:08.828
<v Larry Augustin>driving the idea that we should
rebrand.

864
00:57:11.552 --> 00:57:18.148
<v Larry Augustin>We should push the, we need to
emphasize the notion that what we

865
00:57:18.188 --> 00:57:20.034
<v Larry Augustin>care about is creating great
software.

866
00:57:22.765 --> 00:57:25.091
<v Larry Augustin>We're not making a religious
statement.

867
00:57:25.111 --> 00:57:26.575
<v Larry Augustin>We're not making a political
statement.

868
00:57:27.983 --> 00:57:31.592
<v Larry Augustin>We are simply saying we want to
create great software, and we have

869
00:57:31.632 --> 00:57:35.465
<v Larry Augustin>discovered a model that we believe
creates better software.

870
00:57:36.427 --> 00:57:41.220
<v Larry Augustin>Maybe not in all cases, but
certainly from our observation, in

871
00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.021
<v Larry Augustin>a lot of cases.

872
00:57:42.942 --> 00:57:48.490
<v Larry Augustin>And we need to emphasize that.

873
00:57:50.092 --> 00:57:54.541
<v Larry Augustin>And so, we held a meeting at my
office in Pear Avenue.

874
00:57:55.903 --> 00:58:02.895
<v Larry Augustin>We got Linus on the phone, and
ultimately, the idea was we're

875
00:58:02.935 --> 00:58:07.987
<v Larry Augustin>going to brand this open source,
because the openness of the source

876
00:58:08.047 --> 00:58:10.832
<v Larry Augustin>code was what was important.

877
00:58:12.474 --> 00:58:19.527
<v Larry Augustin>We're going to Bruce Perens, at

878
00:58:19.547 --> 00:58:25.135
<v Larry Augustin>the time, the head of the Debian
project, had created a set of

879
00:58:25.215 --> 00:58:29.106
<v Larry Augustin>definitions for software that
could be part of Debian.

880
00:58:29.587 --> 00:58:33.242
<v Larry Augustin>And we realized the world here
needed to separate the notion

881
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:39.952
<v Larry Augustin>notion of software in which the
source code is available from free

882
00:58:39.992 --> 00:58:44.945
<v Larry Augustin>software, and we coined the term
open source to do that.

883
00:58:45.005 --> 00:58:51.616
<v Larry Augustin>And we all agreed to promote and
develop this, and that became the

884
00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.743
<v Larry Augustin>genesis for the term open source.

885
00:58:57.986 --> 00:58:58.386
<v Larry Augustin>And this was in 1998?

886
00:58:58.386 --> 00:58:58.787
<v Larry Augustin>I think it was 1998.

887
00:58:58.787 --> 00:59:10.421
<v Larry Augustin>I will tell you I'm not as good

888
00:59:10.501 --> 00:59:15.474
<v Larry Augustin>with the years and the dates as I
should be, so I encourage anyone

889
00:59:15.494 --> 00:59:21.849
<v Larry Augustin>listening to this to just go to
the opensource.org website, and

890
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:27.601
<v Larry Augustin>it's well documented there, and
they have made sure the dates are

891
00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:28.022
<v Larry Augustin>correct.

892
00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:30.086
<v Larry Augustin>How's that?

893
00:59:30.948 --> 00:59:32.050
<v Elisabetta Mori>Yeah.

894
00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:34.515
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, during these years, I would

895
00:59:34.535 --> 00:59:35.981
<v Elisabetta Mori>like to ask you a couple of
things.

896
00:59:37.083 --> 00:59:38.385
<v Elisabetta Mori>Two things are personal.

897
00:59:39.106 --> 00:59:40.128
<v Elisabetta Mori>Yes.

898
00:59:40.188 --> 00:59:47.965
<v Elisabetta Mori>First, when was your first
encounter with Linus Torvalds?

899
00:59:47.985 --> 00:59:51.691
<v Elisabetta Mori>Oh, you know, excellent question.

900
01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:05.289
<v Larry Augustin>I don't have a great recollection

901
01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.432
<v Larry Augustin>of the first meeting.

902
01:00:07.632 --> 01:00:15.462
<v Larry Augustin>I'm sure I was so in awe that I

903
01:00:15.542 --> 01:00:22.328
<v Larry Augustin>just was probably standing
stunned.

904
01:00:25.712 --> 01:00:33.342
<v Larry Augustin>I believe it was in the back of a
fast food restaurant at a local

905
01:00:33.423 --> 01:00:36.649
<v Larry Augustin>Linux user group after he had
moved.

906
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:43.207
<v Larry Augustin>You know, many of this happened
remotely, and then Linus moved to

907
01:00:43.568 --> 01:00:46.895
<v Larry Augustin>Silicon Valley in the Bay Area,
and I believe it was the back of a

908
01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.864
<v Larry Augustin>fast food restaurant at a small
Linux user group meeting.

909
01:00:54.010 --> 01:01:02.506
<v Larry Augustin>I was always in awe of just
fantastic talent that came into

910
01:01:02.546 --> 01:01:03.287
<v Larry Augustin>this community.

911
01:01:07.413 --> 01:01:08.855
<v Larry Augustin>When it comes to coding and

912
01:01:08.895 --> 01:01:13.427
<v Larry Augustin>development, I'm more of a
sysadmin hack.

913
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:20.563
<v Larry Augustin>I get some of these things, and I
can pull things together and such,

914
01:01:20.984 --> 01:01:27.593
<v Larry Augustin>but the ability of people like
Linus, my CTO and VA gentleman,

915
01:01:27.673 --> 01:01:35.068
<v Larry Augustin>and the talent that comes together
is just incredible, and the depth

916
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.992
<v Larry Augustin>is incredible there.

917
01:01:37.333 --> 01:01:39.080
<v Larry Augustin>So, we had small Linux user group

918
01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:51.235
<v Larry Augustin>meetings around the Valley, and
then I was eventually sort of able

919
01:01:51.255 --> 01:01:59.749
<v Larry Augustin>to develop a friendship there and
pull Linus into some of those

920
01:01:59.809 --> 01:02:04.697
<v Larry Augustin>events like that Future of Linux
event that I talked about.

921
01:02:04.697 --> 01:02:05.051
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay.

922
01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:05.922
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay.

923
01:02:06.143 --> 01:02:10.171
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, we're going to just talk
briefly about your personal life.

924
01:02:10.531 --> 01:02:15.285
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, when did you get married and
when your daughter was born?

925
01:02:15.305 --> 01:02:17.349
<v Larry Augustin>Oh, wow.

926
01:02:17.469 --> 01:02:17.810
<v Larry Augustin>Okay.

927
01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:18.271
<v Larry Augustin>Okay.

928
01:02:18.571 --> 01:02:23.403
<v Larry Augustin>So, yes, during this, I had met my

929
01:02:23.443 --> 01:02:32.685
<v Larry Augustin>wife at Stanford, Alice, and we
were married in, I want to say,

930
01:02:32.685 --> 01:02:43.652
<v Larry Augustin>96, and our daughter was born a
year later, Andrea, and Alice had

931
01:02:43.772 --> 01:02:50.543
<v Larry Augustin>joined me at VA Research in the
early days and was our first

932
01:02:51.384 --> 01:02:52.025
<v Larry Augustin>salesperson.

933
01:02:53.287 --> 01:02:56.391
<v Larry Augustin>So, the success of the business,

934
01:02:58.013 --> 01:03:06.130
<v Larry Augustin>very much driven by her on the
phone with customers, talking with

935
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:09.576
<v Larry Augustin>customers and helping us create
business.

936
01:03:10.762 --> 01:03:14.148
<v Elisabetta Mori>You met at Stanford, what was she
studying or researching?

937
01:03:14.268 --> 01:03:20.926
<v Larry Augustin>So, she had gone to San Francisco
State and was working in a staff

938
01:03:20.946 --> 01:03:24.995
<v Larry Augustin>position at Stanford in our
research lab, what we've had.

939
01:03:26.723 --> 01:03:27.043
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay.

940
01:03:27.083 --> 01:03:28.042
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, we are like 1997, 1998.

941
01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:28.166
<v Elisabetta Mori>Yes.

942
01:03:28.166 --> 01:03:29.448
<v Elisabetta Mori>Then we arrived to 1999, which is

943
01:03:29.548 --> 01:03:29.849
<v Elisabetta Mori>important.

944
01:03:34.581 --> 01:03:36.825
<v Elisabetta Mori>The end of 1999 is important for

945
01:03:36.925 --> 01:03:38.127
<v Elisabetta Mori>two reasons.

946
01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:43.355
<v Elisabetta Mori>One is SourceForge, we're talking

947
01:03:43.395 --> 01:03:48.829
<v Elisabetta Mori>about number 1999, and the second
one is VA Linux.

948
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:53.403
<v Elisabetta Mori>But if you remember, it's not
important, when did you change the

949
01:03:53.423 --> 01:03:57.074
<v Elisabetta Mori>name from VA Research to VA Linux,
if you remember?

950
01:03:58.162 --> 01:04:03.174
<v Larry Augustin>I don't remember exactly the date,
but it was the, part of it was

951
01:04:03.255 --> 01:04:11.510
<v Larry Augustin>the, it may have been in part the
funding.

952
01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:17.903
<v Larry Augustin>And then as we were thinking about
branding coming into the IPO, the

953
01:04:17.944 --> 01:04:23.833
<v Larry Augustin>term research, just people didn't
quite understand what we did.

954
01:04:24.615 --> 01:04:25.800
<v Larry Augustin>So, we put Linux in the name.

955
01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:26.682
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, yes.

956
01:04:26.742 --> 01:04:29.288
<v Elisabetta Mori>So, the two main things that
happened in 1999, the end of 1999,

957
01:04:29.288 --> 01:04:37.729
<v Elisabetta Mori>November, SourceForge and
September IPO.

958
01:04:38.149 --> 01:04:38.390
<v Larry Augustin>Yeah.

959
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:40.052
<v Larry Augustin>SourceForge, let me tell you a

960
01:04:40.072 --> 01:04:42.096
<v Larry Augustin>little bit about SourceForge.

961
01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.469
<v Larry Augustin>So, I mentioned before that we

962
01:04:47.489 --> 01:04:50.856
<v Larry Augustin>would do things such as host a
machine for the Free Software

963
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:51.541
<v Larry Augustin>Foundation.

964
01:04:51.941 --> 01:04:57.489
<v Larry Augustin>And my vision of a software supply

965
01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:02.961
<v Larry Augustin>chain, if you will, where the
software created for free on the

966
01:05:03.021 --> 01:05:09.574
<v Larry Augustin>internet, openly on the internet,
was our supply chain that we would

967
01:05:09.994 --> 01:05:11.421
<v Larry Augustin>build together into systems.

968
01:05:14.224 --> 01:05:15.366
<v Larry Augustin>I wanted to enable that.

969
01:05:15.806 --> 01:05:25.121
<v Larry Augustin>And we wanted to create and enable
more people to do that and make it

970
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:25.522
<v Larry Augustin>easier.

971
01:05:26.263 --> 01:05:31.671
<v Larry Augustin>So, we regularly hosted websites

972
01:05:32.452 --> 01:05:38.765
<v Larry Augustin>and software distribution FTP
sites for free free software, open

973
01:05:38.805 --> 01:05:40.969
<v Larry Augustin>source, now open source projects.

974
01:05:42.011 --> 01:05:42.693
<v Larry Augustin>That was common.

975
01:05:44.436 --> 01:05:51.150
<v Larry Augustin>At one point, we were, I believe,
hosting upwards of 20 major

976
01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:53.333
<v Larry Augustin>projects like this.

977
01:05:55.296 --> 01:05:59.708
<v Larry Augustin>And we observed that the people

978
01:05:59.808 --> 01:06:02.976
<v Larry Augustin>running these projects all had a
set of common needs.

979
01:06:03.577 --> 01:06:06.670
<v Larry Augustin>You know, they wanted a website,
but they wanted FTP distribution,

980
01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:08.274
<v Larry Augustin>and they wanted a mailing list.

981
01:06:09.443 --> 01:06:10.687
<v Larry Augustin>Sometimes they wanted discussion

982
01:06:10.747 --> 01:06:11.249
<v Larry Augustin>forums.

983
01:06:11.289 --> 01:06:12.954
<v Larry Augustin>They wanted to host FAQs.

984
01:06:15.963 --> 01:06:21.473
<v Larry Augustin>There was a new, I would say,
somewhat new concept that was

985
01:06:21.513 --> 01:06:24.762
<v Larry Augustin>becoming more common among the
groups, which was source code

986
01:06:24.802 --> 01:06:25.564
<v Larry Augustin>repositories.

987
01:06:27.107 --> 01:06:30.955
<v Larry Augustin>Now people just, you know, GitHub.

988
01:06:31.456 --> 01:06:35.909
<v Larry Augustin>And we didn't have Git at the
time.

989
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:40.784
<v Larry Augustin>We had a few different revision
control systems, but most free

990
01:06:40.824 --> 01:06:43.953
<v Larry Augustin>software was not built revision
control, but people were starting

991
01:06:43.973 --> 01:06:49.332
<v Larry Augustin>to say, well, gee, you don't want
to have a CDS or similar revision

992
01:06:49.352 --> 01:06:50.275
<v Larry Augustin>control system site.

993
01:06:50.901 --> 01:06:55.830
<v Larry Augustin>Well, at the same time, there was

994
01:06:55.870 --> 01:07:01.444
<v Larry Augustin>a project underway to recreate the
history of Linux, the history of

995
01:07:01.464 --> 01:07:02.346
<v Larry Augustin>the Linux source code.

996
01:07:04.169 --> 01:07:06.614
<v Larry Augustin>Again, most people at the time

997
01:07:06.674 --> 01:07:09.302
<v Larry Augustin>starting out with a project didn't
start out with revision control.

998
01:07:09.904 --> 01:07:12.468
<v Larry Augustin>Now it's just a given.

999
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.011
<v Larry Augustin>You just do it.

1000
01:07:15.894 --> 01:07:19.866
<v Larry Augustin>And Linux had never done revision
control.

1001
01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:26.238
<v Larry Augustin>He released, you know, he would
release a new version of Linux a

1002
01:07:26.238 --> 01:07:27.693
<v Larry Augustin>new version of Linux out on the
internet, and he didn't

1003
01:07:27.713 --> 01:07:28.696
<v Larry Augustin>necessarily keep old versions.

1004
01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:31.029
<v Larry Augustin>That's, That's, you know, I

1005
01:07:31.129 --> 01:07:32.052
<v Larry Augustin>released it on the internet.

1006
01:07:32.092 --> 01:07:33.536
<v Larry Augustin>I moved on, create a new version.

1007
01:07:33.596 --> 01:07:33.857
<v Larry Augustin>And so, new version.

1008
01:07:33.857 --> 01:07:33.961
<v Larry Augustin>And so, new version.

1009
01:07:33.961 --> 01:07:34.001
<v Larry Augustin>And so, new version.

1010
01:07:34.001 --> 01:07:37.046
<v Larry Augustin>And so, I was observing that we

1011
01:07:37.066 --> 01:07:47.327
<v Larry Augustin>were at a, we were at risk of
losing information that could

1012
01:07:47.407 --> 01:07:51.716
<v Larry Augustin>become important to us as we built
software.

1013
01:07:54.143 --> 01:08:00.274
<v Larry Augustin>Another personal anecdote, I had
discovered at this time a bug in a

1014
01:08:00.314 --> 01:08:06.090
<v Larry Augustin>piece of software on the Linux
system, the bash shell, which is

1015
01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:07.533
<v Larry Augustin>the command line interpreter.

1016
01:08:08.215 --> 01:08:12.306
<v Larry Augustin>And I went to look for the source

1017
01:08:12.367 --> 01:08:17.716
<v Larry Augustin>code to see if I could fix the
bug, and actually couldn't find

1018
01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:18.782
<v Larry Augustin>the source code.

1019
01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:21.589
<v Larry Augustin>Because the version I was running

1020
01:08:21.649 --> 01:08:27.309
<v Larry Augustin>was two releases behind, and none
of the distribution sites kept the

1021
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Larry Augustin>old releases.

1022
01:08:28.511 --> 01:08:29.755
<v Larry Augustin>So, kind of all of these things

1023
01:08:29.795 --> 01:08:32.224
<v Larry Augustin>were coming together at the same
time.

1024
01:08:32.243 --> 01:08:34.790
<v Larry Augustin>So, I did a little math
calculation.

1025
01:08:35.652 --> 01:08:42.948
<v Larry Augustin>And at the time, it's a pretty
good ability to look and

1026
01:08:42.988 --> 01:08:47.323
<v Larry Augustin>understand how much source code
was released, open source and free

1027
01:08:47.363 --> 01:08:48.706
<v Larry Augustin>software on the internet every
year.

1028
01:08:48.727 --> 01:08:54.202
<v Larry Augustin>And I realized, if you took all of
that code and you kept it

1029
01:08:54.261 --> 01:09:01.836
<v Larry Augustin>permanently, it almost tracked to
the size of a large disk drive

1030
01:09:01.856 --> 01:09:06.627
<v Larry Augustin>that you could buy at a very
modest price.

1031
01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Larry Augustin>And so, I realized, there's no,
there's not, you don't need to

1032
01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.904
<v Larry Augustin>delete anything ever again for
source code.

1033
01:09:16.045 --> 01:09:26.961
<v Larry Augustin>So, I wanted to begin to archive
the history of source code.

1034
01:09:28.282 --> 01:09:37.996
<v Larry Augustin>And we had acquired at VA Linux,
we had begun to acquire a set of

1035
01:09:38.036 --> 01:09:42.868
<v Larry Augustin>internet sites that supported free
software and similar development.

1036
01:09:43.751 --> 01:09:46.801
<v Larry Augustin>And one of those sites was a site
called Fresh Meat.

1037
01:09:48.663 --> 01:09:56.935
<v Larry Augustin>Odd name, but Fresh Meat was the
de facto announcement site at the

1038
01:09:56.995 --> 01:09:57.276
<v Larry Augustin>time.

1039
01:09:57.736 --> 01:10:02.748
<v Larry Augustin>So, all free software, that open

1040
01:10:02.788 --> 01:10:07.316
<v Larry Augustin>source software that was released,
was announced on Fresh Meat.

1041
01:10:09.023 --> 01:10:14.775
<v Larry Augustin>And I came up with this vision,
which was, we need to archive all

1042
01:10:14.795 --> 01:10:15.036
<v Larry Augustin>of that.

1043
01:10:16.002 --> 01:10:17.646
<v Larry Augustin>So, my vision was to connect Fresh

1044
01:10:17.726 --> 01:10:21.315
<v Larry Augustin>Meat to an archive site, and I
called it cold storage.

1045
01:10:23.123 --> 01:10:26.630
<v Larry Augustin>So, the idea was to put all Fresh
Meat in cold storage and keep it

1046
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:27.030
<v Larry Augustin>forever.

1047
01:10:28.153 --> 01:10:30.822
<v Larry Augustin>Because we did not want to lose

1048
01:10:30.922 --> 01:10:34.531
<v Larry Augustin>our history, we wanted to
understand how and why things had

1049
01:10:34.571 --> 01:10:35.072
<v Larry Augustin>been built.

1050
01:10:35.513 --> 01:10:38.244
<v Larry Augustin>So, I began this archive project.

1051
01:10:39.226 --> 01:10:44.304
<v Larry Augustin>And the team at VA Linux that I
gave this job to, actually,

1052
01:10:44.822 --> 01:10:48.591
<v Larry Augustin>actually, it was kind of a side
project, if you will, for them,

1053
01:10:49.192 --> 01:10:59.994
<v Larry Augustin>was also the team that, in IT,
that was hosting, helping projects

1054
01:11:00.054 --> 01:11:01.857
<v Larry Augustin>host and build these internet
sites.

1055
01:11:02.802 --> 01:11:05.972
<v Larry Augustin>But if you go back, we famously,
we love doing t-shirts for

1056
01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:06.373
<v Larry Augustin>everything.

1057
01:11:06.433 --> 01:11:10.487
<v Larry Augustin>It's a developer Silicon Valley

1058
01:11:10.507 --> 01:11:11.449
<v Larry Augustin>thing, I guess.

1059
01:11:11.789 --> 01:11:13.052
<v Larry Augustin>But I have these famously, these

1060
01:11:13.152 --> 01:11:16.384
<v Larry Augustin>cold storage t-shirts, we launched
this project.

1061
01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:20.855
<v Larry Augustin>And that team looked at that idea,
and they said, well, that's nice,

1062
01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:25.431
<v Larry Augustin>Larry, but we spend a lot of our
time helping people build these

1063
01:11:25.652 --> 01:11:25.953
<v Larry Augustin>sites.

1064
01:11:26.013 --> 01:11:27.281
<v Larry Augustin>So, we want to bring those ideas

1065
01:11:27.341 --> 01:11:27.742
<v Larry Augustin>together.

1066
01:11:29.505 --> 01:11:32.331
<v Larry Augustin>And they brought those ideas

1067
01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:39.288
<v Larry Augustin>together and ultimately turned
that into, let's not just store an

1068
01:11:39.368 --> 01:11:43.716
<v Larry Augustin>archive, but let's make it easy
for people to build and launch.

1069
01:11:45.823 --> 01:11:50.051
<v Larry Augustin>Cold storage turned out to be a
difficult internet name, and they

1070
01:11:50.091 --> 01:11:51.273
<v Larry Augustin>came up with SourceForge.

1071
01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:56.105
<v Larry Augustin>And we launched SourceForge as the

1072
01:11:56.245 --> 01:12:03.356
<v Larry Augustin>first collaborative development
system for devs on the internet.

1073
01:12:06.004 --> 01:12:09.430
<v Larry Augustin>And our ideas, we wanted to enable
everybody.

1074
01:12:10.512 --> 01:12:14.988
<v Larry Augustin>If you wanted to build an open
source project, we wanted to give

1075
01:12:15.008 --> 01:12:16.233
<v Larry Augustin>you the infrastructure to do it.

1076
01:12:20.301 --> 01:12:23.808
<v Larry Augustin>We had even solicited Intel to

1077
01:12:23.849 --> 01:12:26.855
<v Larry Augustin>provide servers to sit behind this
so that people could compile and

1078
01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.843
<v Larry Augustin>build on the back end.

1079
01:12:30.927 --> 01:12:32.029
<v Larry Augustin>We had a great vision there.

1080
01:12:32.069 --> 01:12:37.522
<v Larry Augustin>And so, we were very excited to be
able to able to offer that to the

1081
01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:41.529
<v Larry Augustin>community when we launched it.

1082
01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:45.296
<v Larry Augustin>That's a little bit of the history

1083
01:12:45.336 --> 01:12:46.121
<v Larry Augustin>behind SourceForge.

1084
01:12:47.403 --> 01:12:49.976
<v Elisabetta Mori>And then on the 9th of December,

1085
01:12:49.976 --> 01:12:51.450
<v Elisabetta Mori>1999, there was the IPO.

1086
01:12:51.471 --> 01:12:51.691
<v Larry Augustin>Yes, yes.

1087
01:12:57.224 --> 01:13:02.234
<v Larry Augustin>Our business, so the original
business around VA Linux had been

1088
01:13:02.274 --> 01:13:05.427
<v Larry Augustin>built around the sort of Sun
workstation concept.

1089
01:13:06.029 --> 01:13:12.148
<v Larry Augustin>As the internet had grown, Linux
and open source software were

1090
01:13:12.168 --> 01:13:16.196
<v Larry Augustin>becoming the de facto software to
use to build the internet.

1091
01:13:17.522 --> 01:13:23.054
<v Larry Augustin>That placed us at a key junction
point in the development of

1092
01:13:23.114 --> 01:13:24.076
<v Larry Augustin>internet technology.

1093
01:13:27.223 --> 01:13:30.047
<v Larry Augustin>And our business had become all

1094
01:13:30.127 --> 01:13:41.024
<v Larry Augustin>about making high performance,
easy to use systems at a

1095
01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:45.372
<v Larry Augustin>reasonable cost available to
people who wanted to build out and

1096
01:13:45.412 --> 01:13:46.835
<v Larry Augustin>host internet sites.

1097
01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:50.045
<v Larry Augustin>That had become the most

1098
01:13:50.065 --> 01:13:52.349
<v Larry Augustin>significant part of the market.

1099
01:13:53.331 --> 01:13:56.316
<v Larry Augustin>And it was growing rapidly,

1100
01:13:56.881 --> 01:13:57.983
<v Larry Augustin>rapidly at the time.

1101
01:13:58.965 --> 01:14:02.473
<v Larry Augustin>And that led us to grow a very

1102
01:14:02.593 --> 01:14:03.735
<v Larry Augustin>significant business.

1103
01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:07.425
<v Larry Augustin>We were doing about 60 million in

1104
01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:09.408
<v Larry Augustin>revenue at the time.

1105
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:14.456
<v Larry Augustin>And we decided to go public.

1106
01:14:17.025 --> 01:14:19.991
<v Larry Augustin>Today, you'd wait a little bit
longer, I think.

1107
01:14:20.151 --> 01:14:23.418
<v Larry Augustin>But then, there were smaller
public companies.

1108
01:14:23.418 --> 01:14:24.404
<v Larry Augustin>And public companies.

1109
01:14:24.404 --> 01:14:25.546
<v Larry Augustin>And we were right at the forefront

1110
01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:25.926
<v Larry Augustin>of that.

1111
01:14:26.527 --> 01:14:31.857
<v Larry Augustin>So, we set out to define that as

1112
01:14:31.897 --> 01:14:32.378
<v Larry Augustin>the business.

1113
01:14:32.378 --> 01:14:32.428
<v Larry Augustin>And we went public December 1999.

1114
01:14:32.428 --> 01:14:32.468
<v Larry Augustin>that as the business.

1115
01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:33.102
<v Larry Augustin>And we went public December 1999.

1116
01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:43.960
<v Larry Augustin>And ultimately, that became the
largest first day gain ever in an

1117
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:44.140
<v Larry Augustin>IPO.

1118
01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:45.742
<v Larry Augustin>We priced the IPO, and I believe

1119
01:14:45.762 --> 01:14:46.603
<v Larry Augustin>it was $30 a share.

1120
01:14:57.839 --> 01:15:00.583
<v Larry Augustin>And the first opening trade was at

1121
01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:04.010
<v Larry Augustin>$299 a share, as there was just
huge demand.

1122
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.466
<v Larry Augustin>As part of that, we also did what
I think was also the first ever

1123
01:15:11.486 --> 01:15:18.781
<v Larry Augustin>large-scale community involvement
in an IPO.

1124
01:15:19.402 --> 01:15:23.547
<v Larry Augustin>There was a concept that I began
developing.

1125
01:15:24.609 --> 01:15:32.902
<v Larry Augustin>I had hired a team of people at VA
Linux to do what we call community

1126
01:15:32.942 --> 01:15:33.483
<v Larry Augustin>marketing.

1127
01:15:33.503 --> 01:15:35.987
<v Larry Augustin>This is outreach to Linux users

1128
01:15:36.007 --> 01:15:44.785
<v Larry Augustin>groups, outreach to developers,
people working on the Linux

1129
01:15:44.826 --> 01:15:45.166
<v Larry Augustin>kernel.

1130
01:15:45.186 --> 01:15:46.168
<v Larry Augustin>And we assembled a list of core

1131
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.623
<v Larry Augustin>contributors to Linux and open
source.

1132
01:15:51.643 --> 01:16:01.160
<v Larry Augustin>And we included them in the IPO,
gave them the opportunity to get

1133
01:16:01.181 --> 01:16:01.221
<v Larry Augustin>in.

1134
01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:03.685
<v Larry Augustin>And hopefully, let them make some

1135
01:16:03.705 --> 01:16:05.548
<v Larry Augustin>money for all their hard-earned
work off of that.

1136
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.646
<v Larry Augustin>And to this day, I still get
people from those days telling me

1137
01:16:13.666 --> 01:16:18.642
<v Larry Augustin>that that made a difference for
them, which is just hugely

1138
01:16:18.723 --> 01:16:19.545
<v Larry Augustin>gratifying for me.

1139
01:16:19.565 --> 01:16:20.507
<v Larry Augustin>But we did this in a large scale.

1140
01:16:20.647 --> 01:16:26.686
<v Larry Augustin>And the bankers, to be honest, at
first, weren't really quite sure

1141
01:16:27.027 --> 01:16:27.628
<v Larry Augustin>how to do this.

1142
01:16:27.689 --> 01:16:31.160
<v Larry Augustin>So we had to come up with a lot of

1143
01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:31.321
<v Larry Augustin>ideas.

1144
01:16:31.341 --> 01:16:32.062
<v Larry Augustin>And the banking team had to be

1145
01:16:32.082 --> 01:16:38.541
<v Larry Augustin>invented in order for us to have
several thousand people from all

1146
01:16:38.561 --> 01:16:47.304
<v Larry Augustin>over the world participate, many
of whom were just their name was

1147
01:16:47.364 --> 01:16:48.046
<v Larry Augustin>in the Linux kernel.

1148
01:16:48.066 --> 01:16:49.911
<v Larry Augustin>And they were a contributor.

1149
01:16:49.931 --> 01:16:51.846
<v Larry Augustin>And we wanted to try and help them
or reward them.

1150
01:16:51.846 --> 01:16:51.956
<v Larry Augustin>So we wanted to try and help them
or reward them.

1151
01:16:51.956 --> 01:16:52.102
<v Larry Augustin>So we did that.

1152
01:16:52.122 --> 01:16:55.230
<v Larry Augustin>How many people were employed by

1153
01:16:55.250 --> 01:17:08.541
<v Larry Augustin>you at the time?
I want to say at the IPO time, the

1154
01:17:08.581 --> 01:17:12.449
<v Larry Augustin>company was still relatively
small.

1155
01:17:13.732 --> 01:17:16.042
<v Larry Augustin>I will say 250 people, ultimately
ultimately growing to about 800

1156
01:17:16.042 --> 01:17:18.007
<v Larry Augustin>people over the course of the next
two years.

1157
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.525
<v Elisabetta Mori>And in 2000, Word Magazine named
you to their list of the top 50

1158
01:17:23.525 --> 01:17:23.605
<v Elisabetta Mori>CEOs.

1159
01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.669
<v Larry Augustin>Yes, yes, yes.

1160
01:17:34.142 --> 01:17:38.711
<v Larry Augustin>You know, learning on the job was
a lot of that.

1161
01:17:38.851 --> 01:17:43.066
<v Larry Augustin>I just had some fantastic people
around people around me and

1162
01:17:43.086 --> 01:17:45.212
<v Larry Augustin>fantastic investors in Sequoia
Capital.

1163
01:17:46.902 --> 01:17:48.785
<v Larry Augustin>And I was able to get a lot of
people involved.

1164
01:17:48.805 --> 01:17:50.188
<v Larry Augustin>And I was able to get a lot of
people involved.

1165
01:17:54.421 --> 01:18:03.409
<v Larry Augustin>And fantastic investors in Sequoia
Capital, fantastic mentors who

1166
01:18:03.469 --> 01:18:08.016
<v Larry Augustin>helped the company and joined
around the board from people like

1167
01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.243
<v Larry Augustin>Doug Leonio at Sequoia.

1168
01:18:12.568 --> 01:18:14.251
<v Larry Augustin>Carol Bartz was a great mentor for

1169
01:18:14.291 --> 01:18:15.895
<v Larry Augustin>me on the board.

1170
01:18:16.015 --> 01:18:19.385
<v Larry Augustin>Carol had run marketing at Sun.

1171
01:18:21.008 --> 01:18:23.553
<v Larry Augustin>And at the time, she sat on our
board.

1172
01:18:23.573 --> 01:18:26.101
<v Larry Augustin>I believe she was the CEO of
Autodesk.

1173
01:18:28.045 --> 01:18:31.713
<v Larry Augustin>Later, interestingly, to sort of
bring some things full circle, she

1174
01:18:31.753 --> 01:18:34.503
<v Larry Augustin>became the CEO of Yahoo for a
while.

1175
01:18:37.548 --> 01:18:42.896
<v Larry Augustin>But just, you know, fantastic,
fantastic people all around.

1176
01:18:45.505 --> 01:18:49.854
<v Elisabetta Mori>So what happened between the 2000
and the year 2002 when you left?

1177
01:18:52.923 --> 01:18:53.584
<v Larry Augustin>Yes.

1178
01:18:53.824 --> 01:18:56.348
<v Larry Augustin>So, so our business had been

1179
01:18:56.668 --> 01:19:02.857
<v Larry Augustin>heavily defined by companies, the
dot com world at that time.

1180
01:19:03.898 --> 01:19:07.766
<v Larry Augustin>And and And and the business was
growing very, very rapidly.

1181
01:19:07.786 --> 01:19:17.842
<v Larry Augustin>And that was all going well until
the dot com crash, if you will.

1182
01:19:18.483 --> 01:19:26.596
<v Larry Augustin>The the companies that we were
selling to were a who's who of dot

1183
01:19:26.656 --> 01:19:26.996
<v Larry Augustin>coms.

1184
01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:31.088
<v Larry Augustin>You know, companies like Pets.com

1185
01:19:31.589 --> 01:19:35.817
<v Larry Augustin>come up as a sort of poster child
here.

1186
01:19:35.917 --> 01:19:44.114
<v Larry Augustin>But over the course of about six
months, many of our customers

1187
01:19:45.076 --> 01:19:48.384
<v Larry Augustin>either went out of business or out
of business or just stopped,

1188
01:19:49.146 --> 01:19:49.907
<v Larry Augustin>stopped by.

1189
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:54.815
<v Larry Augustin>And it was a big crash for us in

1190
01:19:54.855 --> 01:19:55.516
<v Larry Augustin>that space.

1191
01:19:56.217 --> 01:19:58.404
<v Larry Augustin>And ultimately, we restructured

1192
01:19:58.464 --> 01:20:03.213
<v Larry Augustin>the company to focus around
SourceForge and the software

1193
01:20:03.233 --> 01:20:07.365
<v Larry Augustin>business and less about Internet
servers.

1194
01:20:08.488 --> 01:20:11.234
<v Larry Augustin>And we did we did many innovative
things in the Internet Service

1195
01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:11.675
<v Larry Augustin>Society.

1196
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.104
<v Larry Augustin>We built the first high density

1197
01:20:13.224 --> 01:20:16.172
<v Larry Augustin>rack mount servers that went into
data centers.

1198
01:20:16.212 --> 01:20:17.641
<v Larry Augustin>We did that to run the dot coms.

1199
01:20:19.163 --> 01:20:24.391
<v Larry Augustin>But ultimately, when that part of

1200
01:20:24.411 --> 01:20:29.062
<v Larry Augustin>the market crashed, it became very
difficult for us to maintain that

1201
01:20:29.122 --> 01:20:29.482
<v Larry Augustin>business.

1202
01:20:30.404 --> 01:20:32.689
<v Larry Augustin>So we started restructuring the

1203
01:20:32.729 --> 01:20:38.003
<v Larry Augustin>business, ultimately had to
downsize, went through a very,

1204
01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:46.937
<v Larry Augustin>very painful time where we had to
we had to lay off groups of people

1205
01:20:47.921 --> 01:20:48.542
<v Larry Augustin>to get there.

1206
01:20:49.003 --> 01:20:52.549
<v Larry Augustin>And we emerged as a smaller

1207
01:20:52.589 --> 01:20:56.456
<v Larry Augustin>company, more software focused,
focused around SourceForge.

1208
01:20:59.064 --> 01:21:05.534
<v Larry Augustin>And I'm very proud that we were
able to sort of survive through

1209
01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:06.996
<v Larry Augustin>that crash and downturn.

1210
01:21:09.003 --> 01:21:10.165
<v Larry Augustin>But for me, it was a different

1211
01:21:10.185 --> 01:21:10.626
<v Larry Augustin>business.

1212
01:21:11.808 --> 01:21:15.796
<v Larry Augustin>And when I got it to that point,

1213
01:21:17.343 --> 01:21:20.349
<v Larry Augustin>it was no longer as interesting or
exciting for me.

1214
01:21:20.369 --> 01:21:24.361
<v Larry Augustin>And it was time for me to go on
and do something different.

1215
01:21:26.745 --> 01:21:31.474
<v Larry Augustin>And what did you do in 2002?
So at that point, looking for

1216
01:21:31.494 --> 01:21:36.408
<v Larry Augustin>looking for kind of the next phase
of my career, some friends of mine

1217
01:21:36.448 --> 01:21:40.662
<v Larry Augustin>had joined, had created, had
founded a venture capital firm up

1218
01:21:40.722 --> 01:21:42.586
<v Larry Augustin>in San Francisco called Azure
Capital.

1219
01:21:43.688 --> 01:21:47.740
<v Larry Augustin>I loved, I loved the entrepreneur
stage.

1220
01:21:47.801 --> 01:21:49.605
<v Larry Augustin>I loved everything I'd learned
there.

1221
01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:53.861
<v Larry Augustin>And I had met many great people
who were launching businesses.

1222
01:21:54.221 --> 01:22:02.174
<v Larry Augustin>And many people told me that the
VA Linux IPO had been very

1223
01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:04.983
<v Larry Augustin>inspirational to them,
particularly coming out of the

1224
01:22:05.064 --> 01:22:08.780
<v Larry Augustin>open source software world with
the idea that that you could

1225
01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:11.448
<v Larry Augustin>create something here, you could
create something potentially world

1226
01:22:11.488 --> 01:22:11.909
<v Larry Augustin>changing.

1227
01:22:12.631 --> 01:22:16.766
<v Larry Augustin>And so I I joined my friends up at

1228
01:22:16.826 --> 01:22:22.764
<v Larry Augustin>Azure Capital and began to learn
the venture capital side of the

1229
01:22:22.884 --> 01:22:23.325
<v Larry Augustin>business.

1230
01:22:23.867 --> 01:22:25.210
<v Larry Augustin>And I wanted to take my

1231
01:22:25.271 --> 01:22:29.707
<v Larry Augustin>experiences and share them and
help others that were looking to

1232
01:22:29.747 --> 01:22:30.188
<v Larry Augustin>do that.

1233
01:22:30.268 --> 01:22:32.473
<v Larry Augustin>And so I spent a few years up at

1234
01:22:32.533 --> 01:22:40.233
<v Larry Augustin>Azure Capital, ultimately decided,
it's a fantastic firm, I love, I

1235
01:22:40.294 --> 01:22:41.195
<v Larry Augustin>love those guys.

1236
01:22:41.296 --> 01:22:44.025
<v Larry Augustin>And they're all great friends.

1237
01:22:45.207 --> 01:22:52.687
<v Larry Augustin>Today, to this day, ultimately
decided that I really wanted to do

1238
01:22:52.747 --> 01:23:02.094
<v Larry Augustin>it on my own, in the sense that I
wanted to back and follow

1239
01:23:02.114 --> 01:23:04.639
<v Larry Augustin>entrepreneurs that I wanted to
spend time with, it didn't

1240
01:23:04.659 --> 01:23:04.970
<v Larry Augustin>necessarily make sense for a firm
to be investing in.

1241
01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:05.104
<v Larry Augustin>So I spent I wanted to spend time
with, it didn't necessarily make

1242
01:23:05.104 --> 01:23:05.184
<v Larry Augustin>sense for a firm to be investing
in.

1243
01:23:05.184 --> 01:23:06.247
<v Larry Augustin>So I spent a few years at Azure
Capital.

1244
01:23:06.327 --> 01:23:12.924
<v Larry Augustin>And then I spent a few years on my
own, angel investing, and helping

1245
01:23:12.944 --> 01:23:13.745
<v Larry Augustin>early stage companies.

1246
01:23:14.646 --> 01:23:23.663
<v Larry Augustin>Again, just early stage companies,

1247
01:23:24.385 --> 01:23:27.993
<v Larry Augustin>again, just lucky enough to be
involved with some fantastic

1248
01:23:28.093 --> 01:23:28.835
<v Larry Augustin>entrepreneurs.

1249
01:23:31.723 --> 01:23:33.827
<v Larry Augustin>Early on, people like Mark Fleury,

1250
01:23:33.887 --> 01:23:40.663
<v Larry Augustin>who was the founder of JBoss, I
sat on that board, and companies

1251
01:23:40.703 --> 01:23:47.515
<v Larry Augustin>like Zensource, Spring, and
Pentaho, Richard Daly over there

1252
01:23:47.555 --> 01:23:51.693
<v Larry Augustin>built a incredible company around
open source business intelligence.

1253
01:23:53.302 --> 01:24:00.234
<v Larry Augustin>And I was lucky enough to be
involved with many great open

1254
01:24:00.394 --> 01:24:04.184
<v Larry Augustin>source primarily, businesses and
entrepreneurs.

1255
01:24:06.368 --> 01:24:07.350
<v Larry Augustin>Learned a ton.

1256
01:24:08.592 --> 01:24:09.674
<v Larry Augustin>It's one of the things that I

1257
01:24:09.694 --> 01:24:12.965
<v Larry Augustin>always, I was like doing things in
my career where I learned new

1258
01:24:13.005 --> 01:24:13.326
<v Larry Augustin>things.

1259
01:24:14.369 --> 01:24:15.713
<v Larry Augustin>Going into venture capital was

1260
01:24:15.753 --> 01:24:16.580
<v Larry Augustin>learning a new thing.

1261
01:24:18.826 --> 01:24:20.550
<v Larry Augustin>Doing it on my own was learning a

1262
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:21.072
<v Larry Augustin>new thing.

1263
01:24:21.172 --> 01:24:23.041
<v Larry Augustin>Every one of these companies, I

1264
01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:27.270
<v Larry Augustin>learned tremendously from every
one of those great entrepreneurs

1265
01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:28.051
<v Larry Augustin>and CEOs.

1266
01:24:30.095 --> 01:24:36.788
<v Larry Augustin>And along the way, I had been

1267
01:24:37.088 --> 01:24:42.860
<v Larry Augustin>invited to come help out as an
independent board member, and

1268
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:49.029
<v Larry Augustin>advisor to an open source company
in the CRM space, SugarCRM.

1269
01:24:50.671 --> 01:24:58.567
<v Larry Augustin>And so I joined the board over at
SugarCRM and put a little money as

1270
01:24:58.608 --> 01:25:03.081
<v Larry Augustin>an investor, and had spent several
years on the board there.

1271
01:25:03.101 --> 01:25:09.174
<v Larry Augustin>And there was a theme I was
developing, which was that open

1272
01:25:09.194 --> 01:25:11.002
<v Larry Augustin>source was moving up the software
stack.

1273
01:25:13.387 --> 01:25:19.623
<v Larry Augustin>Now there's the famous quote that
software eats the world, and open

1274
01:25:19.663 --> 01:25:22.127
<v Larry Augustin>source eats all software, if you
will.

1275
01:25:22.608 --> 01:25:27.056
<v Larry Augustin>Right?
I did not coin those phrases, but

1276
01:25:28.703 --> 01:25:29.344
<v Larry Augustin>very true.

1277
01:25:30.265 --> 01:25:34.333
<v Larry Augustin>And I had spent more time moving

1278
01:25:34.393 --> 01:25:36.056
<v Larry Augustin>up and learning business
applications.

1279
01:25:37.642 --> 01:25:44.715
<v Larry Augustin>Ultimately, the investors over at
SugarCRM said, Larry, we need to

1280
01:25:44.735 --> 01:25:46.181
<v Larry Augustin>figure out what to do with this
business.

1281
01:25:47.243 --> 01:25:48.646
<v Larry Augustin>We've been kind of stalled.

1282
01:25:49.187 --> 01:25:50.290
<v Larry Augustin>Would you take a look at it?

1283
01:25:50.671 --> 01:25:53.200
<v Larry Augustin>You're the operating person here.

1284
01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:54.885
<v Larry Augustin>You've run the business.

1285
01:25:54.945 --> 01:25:56.689
<v Larry Augustin>You know open source.

1286
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:58.814
<v Larry Augustin>You don't know CRM, but will you

1287
01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:01.845
<v Larry Augustin>take a look?
And I ultimately spent 10 years in

1288
01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:02.386
<v Larry Augustin>that company.

1289
01:26:03.768 --> 01:26:07.595
<v Larry Augustin>Grew it into, in many ways, I

1290
01:26:07.635 --> 01:26:11.227
<v Larry Augustin>think a very influential company
for the open source world in the

1291
01:26:11.267 --> 01:26:12.129
<v Larry Augustin>CRM space.

1292
01:26:12.791 --> 01:26:15.821
<v Larry Augustin>We had fantastic customers, such

1293
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:23.774
<v Larry Augustin>as IBM and Apple, SugarCRM
customers, and grew that business

1294
01:26:23.794 --> 01:26:28.065
<v Larry Augustin>for many years before selling into
a private equity firm, XLKKR.

1295
01:26:30.610 --> 01:26:31.852
<v Larry Augustin>Fantastic experience.

1296
01:26:32.033 --> 01:26:33.375
<v Larry Augustin>Great, great team.

1297
01:26:33.435 --> 01:26:38.608
<v Larry Augustin>I was lucky enough to be able to
write off of the efforts of

1298
01:26:38.688 --> 01:26:40.431
<v Larry Augustin>founders there, such as Quintor.

1299
01:26:42.535 --> 01:26:46.644
<v Larry Augustin>Just incredible team.

1300
01:26:46.864 --> 01:26:50.750
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay, so you became CEO in 2009?
Yes.

1301
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:53.013
<v Elisabetta Mori>And you left in 2019?
Yes, yes.

1302
01:26:58.243 --> 01:27:04.532
<v Elisabetta Mori>What did you do in 2019?
Yes, so after we sold the company

1303
01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:08.017
<v Larry Augustin>to XLKKR, I left SugarCRM.

1304
01:27:09.482 --> 01:27:12.648
<v Larry Augustin>I got a call from Amazon, an

1305
01:27:12.688 --> 01:27:25.709
<v Larry Augustin>interest in developing and
building more of the software that

1306
01:27:25.749 --> 01:27:28.593
<v Larry Augustin>was moving up the stack on AWS.

1307
01:27:29.414 --> 01:27:31.097
<v Larry Augustin>Amazon had built a set of

1308
01:27:31.741 --> 01:27:36.650
<v Larry Augustin>products, particular things like
their Connect call center product,

1309
01:27:36.931 --> 01:27:41.984
<v Larry Augustin>their WorkDocs file management
product, messaging and

1310
01:27:42.024 --> 01:27:48.475
<v Larry Augustin>communications, video
conferencing, and chat.

1311
01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:51.005
<v Larry Augustin>And they were trying to figure out
what to do with these products,

1312
01:27:51.066 --> 01:27:52.652
<v Larry Augustin>and they put them together into a
group.

1313
01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:56.749
<v Larry Augustin>And we're looking for someone to
help grow and develop that and

1314
01:27:56.809 --> 01:28:01.703
<v Larry Augustin>understand where to go with those
applications on AWS.

1315
01:28:02.424 --> 01:28:10.617
<v Larry Augustin>And if you are an entrepreneur,
and you've been building in the

1316
01:28:14.124 --> 01:28:17.490
<v Larry Augustin>mid to late 2000s, you're probably
building on AWS.

1317
01:28:18.312 --> 01:28:23.027
<v Larry Augustin>One of the things we had done at
SugarCRM was move to AWS for many

1318
01:28:23.067 --> 01:28:23.829
<v Larry Augustin>of our services.

1319
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:25.934
<v Larry Augustin>And this was a common theme.

1320
01:28:28.364 --> 01:28:31.451
<v Larry Augustin>So I went over to AWS and was
lucky enough to be able to run

1321
01:28:31.471 --> 01:28:37.728
<v Larry Augustin>some very significant businesses
there for a couple of years and

1322
01:28:37.748 --> 01:28:39.571
<v Larry Augustin>help build those out.

1323
01:28:39.952 --> 01:28:40.934
<v Larry Augustin>It was fantastic.

1324
01:28:40.954 --> 01:28:41.856
<v Larry Augustin>I enjoyed it.

1325
01:28:41.856 --> 01:28:44.255
<v Larry Augustin>It's it.

1326
01:28:44.255 --> 01:28:45.569
<v Larry Augustin>It's a little bit of a different
experience.

1327
01:28:47.694 --> 01:28:49.899
<v Larry Augustin>Again, I wanted to learn.

1328
01:28:53.088 --> 01:28:55.913
<v Larry Augustin>If you look at my career, I've

1329
01:28:55.953 --> 01:28:59.280
<v Larry Augustin>made decisions all along the way
to do things that I've never done

1330
01:28:59.280 --> 01:28:59.484
<v Larry Augustin>before, because I want to learn
and I want to understand, the way

1331
01:28:59.484 --> 01:28:59.614
<v Larry Augustin>to do things that I've never done
before, because I want to learn

1332
01:28:59.614 --> 01:29:02.230
<v Larry Augustin>and I want to understand, and I
want to stretch myself.

1333
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:12.454
<v Larry Augustin>And I'm never afraid to try things
that I don't know how to do.

1334
01:29:12.474 --> 01:29:15.779
<v Larry Augustin>I had a great experience over at
AWS for that.

1335
01:29:15.779 --> 01:29:15.899
<v Larry Augustin>Ultimately, I decided had a great
experience over at AWS for that.

1336
01:29:15.899 --> 01:29:18.066
<v Larry Augustin>Ultimately, I decided that I
wasn't going to stay in that big

1337
01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:27.223
<v Larry Augustin>company for a long time and went
back to being an angel investor

1338
01:29:27.263 --> 01:29:32.552
<v Larry Augustin>and advising and working with
early stage companies.

1339
01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.004
<v Larry Augustin>And that's what I'm doing today.

1340
01:29:37.525 --> 01:29:38.768
<v Elisabetta Mori>So did you move to Seattle when

1341
01:29:38.808 --> 01:29:44.085
<v Elisabetta Mori>you... I did not move to Seattle.

1342
01:29:45.468 --> 01:29:46.911
<v Larry Augustin>I did Seattle part-time.

1343
01:29:46.931 --> 01:29:53.106
<v Larry Augustin>So I had just the schedule that
was every other week.

1344
01:29:54.408 --> 01:29:58.294
<v Larry Augustin>So I'm a firm believer, just
philosophically, that you have to

1345
01:29:58.334 --> 01:29:59.916
<v Larry Augustin>be near the team and the people.

1346
01:30:00.921 --> 01:30:06.131
<v Larry Augustin>And so I got an apartment in

1347
01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:08.435
<v Larry Augustin>Seattle, and I went to Seattle
every other week and spend time

1348
01:30:08.475 --> 01:30:08.656
<v Larry Augustin>there.

1349
01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.283
<v Larry Augustin>I also, by the way, had teams in

1350
01:30:10.303 --> 01:30:10.784
<v Larry Augustin>the Bay Area.

1351
01:30:11.366 --> 01:30:14.673
<v Larry Augustin>So I had offices in San Francisco

1352
01:30:14.734 --> 01:30:19.209
<v Larry Augustin>and Seattle, and I had teams in
Silicon Valley, San Francisco,

1353
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:22.643
<v Larry Augustin>Seattle, and around Washington, as
well as around the country,

1354
01:30:23.966 --> 01:30:25.349
<v Larry Augustin>working for me at AWS.

1355
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:27.335
<v Larry Augustin>And so I would go back and forth.

1356
01:30:28.942 --> 01:30:39.415
<v Elisabetta Mori>So now that you're only focused on
being an angel investor, what is

1357
01:30:39.435 --> 01:30:45.065
<v Elisabetta Mori>your angel investment strategy?
So, or let me rephrase, how did

1358
01:30:45.286 --> 01:30:49.512
<v Elisabetta Mori>your strategy evolve from the
beginning?

1359
01:30:49.812 --> 01:30:57.707
<v Elisabetta Mori>And if it at all changed, if it
evolved from the beginning?

1360
01:30:57.907 --> 01:31:00.892
<v Larry Augustin>Sure, sure, sure.

1361
01:31:02.154 --> 01:31:05.063
<v Larry Augustin>It's interesting watching the

1362
01:31:05.123 --> 01:31:08.832
<v Larry Augustin>history of open source and
commercial companies, because it's

1363
01:31:08.852 --> 01:31:09.955
<v Larry Augustin>gone through some cycles.

1364
01:31:11.402 --> 01:31:14.728
<v Larry Augustin>Where it was very popular, less

1365
01:31:14.808 --> 01:31:15.429
<v Larry Augustin>popular.

1366
01:31:16.191 --> 01:31:18.114
<v Larry Augustin>Now, it's very popular, and it's

1367
01:31:18.154 --> 01:31:18.795
<v Larry Augustin>very common.

1368
01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:20.945
<v Larry Augustin>And I think many people realize

1369
01:31:20.965 --> 01:31:26.365
<v Larry Augustin>that you can build a great,
significant business around and

1370
01:31:26.425 --> 01:31:29.892
<v Larry Augustin>related to and using open source
technologies.

1371
01:31:29.972 --> 01:31:33.264
<v Larry Augustin>And to the point where you'll see
many companies that talk about

1372
01:31:33.304 --> 01:31:36.774
<v Larry Augustin>proprietary software, and
investors will look at them and

1373
01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.871
<v Larry Augustin>actually ask the question, should
you be doing some of this open

1374
01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:45.408
<v Larry Augustin>source?
So I don't mind open source,

1375
01:31:45.508 --> 01:31:45.989
<v Larry Augustin>obviously.

1376
01:31:48.153 --> 01:31:49.555
<v Larry Augustin>I've always felt one could build a

1377
01:31:49.575 --> 01:31:50.641
<v Larry Augustin>great business around it.

1378
01:31:51.724 --> 01:31:52.927
<v Larry Augustin>I've always felt that companies

1379
01:31:52.967 --> 01:31:55.914
<v Larry Augustin>have been too protective of their
source code.

1380
01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:02.171
<v Larry Augustin>But in fact, the value is in the
people and the culture and

1381
01:32:03.413 --> 01:32:05.923
<v Larry Augustin>everything you've built around
that, and and not necessarily in

1382
01:32:05.943 --> 01:32:07.808
<v Larry Augustin>just access to the code.

1383
01:32:08.088 --> 01:32:09.211
<v Larry Augustin>So I do a lot of open source.

1384
01:32:09.853 --> 01:32:12.305
<v Larry Augustin>It's a long way of saying I do a
lot of investing around open

1385
01:32:12.345 --> 01:32:16.822
<v Larry Augustin>source, because I think it's a
great, great incubator for great

1386
01:32:16.862 --> 01:32:17.563
<v Larry Augustin>technologies.

1387
01:32:18.806 --> 01:32:20.910
<v Larry Augustin>I love helping entrepreneurs that

1388
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:24.962
<v Larry Augustin>are first time entrepreneurs, that
are trying to understand how to go

1389
01:32:24.983 --> 01:32:27.086
<v Larry Augustin>through the process.

1390
01:32:28.369 --> 01:32:31.634
<v Larry Augustin>I love seeing interesting

1391
01:32:31.674 --> 01:32:32.356
<v Larry Augustin>technologies.

1392
01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.305
<v Larry Augustin>I've been lucky enough to be at

1393
01:32:35.346 --> 01:32:39.795
<v Larry Augustin>the forefront of some very
interesting technological changes

1394
01:32:40.741 --> 01:32:41.803
<v Larry Augustin>in our world and culture.

1395
01:32:43.485 --> 01:32:46.330
<v Larry Augustin>Linux, open source, I spent time

1396
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:52.884
<v Larry Augustin>at AWS, the internet and web, I've
just been around those.

1397
01:32:54.747 --> 01:32:58.355
<v Larry Augustin>I think we are at a similar
junction right now with AI.

1398
01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:02.893
<v Larry Augustin>I know I'm not unique in saying
that, but I believe that many

1399
01:33:04.222 --> 01:33:08.230
<v Larry Augustin>types of software and applications
are going to be fundamentally

1400
01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:13.503
<v Larry Augustin>restructured in how they're built,
and how they solve problems for

1401
01:33:13.563 --> 01:33:15.646
<v Larry Augustin>people using AI.

1402
01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:22.076
<v Larry Augustin>And so I look a lot of ways of

1403
01:33:22.116 --> 01:33:29.932
<v Larry Augustin>just how can we rethink a problem
and be able to solve it with AI.

1404
01:33:29.952 --> 01:33:35.486
<v Larry Augustin>I mean, my computer science
background comes out here a bit in

1405
01:33:35.547 --> 01:33:38.474
<v Larry Augustin>the sense that there are many
problems that are algorithmically

1406
01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.281
<v Larry Augustin>very hard.

1407
01:33:39.943 --> 01:33:42.129
<v Larry Augustin>Problems that we might

1408
01:33:42.169 --> 01:33:48.508
<v Larry Augustin>traditionally have said fall into
the NP complete path where they're

1409
01:33:49.230 --> 01:33:51.876
<v Larry Augustin>non-polynomial time solutions.

1410
01:33:51.916 --> 01:33:53.239
<v Larry Augustin>They're very complicated, and

1411
01:33:53.339 --> 01:33:53.749
<v Larry Augustin>they're hard, and they take a lot
of time to solve.

1412
01:33:53.749 --> 01:33:59.640
<v Larry Augustin>But we can now, using machine
learning, create some pretty good

1413
01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.225
<v Larry Augustin>approximations to solutions that
we couldn't in the past.

1414
01:34:02.425 --> 01:34:10.487
<v Larry Augustin>We can now do processing around We
can now do processing around

1415
01:34:10.567 --> 01:34:12.674
<v Larry Augustin>natural language that we couldn't
do in the past.

1416
01:34:14.285 --> 01:34:17.113
<v Larry Augustin>I'm super excited about the things
that we can do as a result of

1417
01:34:17.153 --> 01:34:17.374
<v Larry Augustin>that.

1418
01:34:18.082 --> 01:34:20.328
<v Larry Augustin>So those are some of the things,

1419
01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:22.794
<v Larry Augustin>some of the things that I think
about there.

1420
01:34:26.304 --> 01:34:29.010
<v Elisabetta Mori>You don't look back at your life
until now.

1421
01:34:30.192 --> 01:34:31.856
<v Elisabetta Mori>What are your proudest
achievements?

1422
01:34:35.605 --> 01:34:41.675
<v Larry Augustin>Oh, I will start with something we
haven't talked a lot about, but I

1423
01:34:41.695 --> 01:34:42.797
<v Larry Augustin>have a wonderful family.

1424
01:34:45.124 --> 01:34:46.626
<v Larry Augustin>My daughter is my proudest

1425
01:34:46.687 --> 01:34:47.228
<v Larry Augustin>achievement.

1426
01:34:50.033 --> 01:34:51.155
<v Larry Augustin>My daughter is my proudest

1427
01:34:51.195 --> 01:34:51.696
<v Larry Augustin>achievement.

1428
01:34:54.044 --> 01:34:56.188
<v Larry Augustin>She studied computer engineering

1429
01:34:56.488 --> 01:34:59.554
<v Larry Augustin>and gaming, and theater, film, and
television.

1430
01:35:00.336 --> 01:35:05.573
<v Larry Augustin>So I'm just super proud as a dad.

1431
01:35:10.223 --> 01:35:15.733
<v Larry Augustin>On the sort of career side, I'm

1432
01:35:15.793 --> 01:35:21.586
<v Larry Augustin>proud that I've been able to help
some people create the things that

1433
01:35:21.606 --> 01:35:22.528
<v Larry Augustin>they've been able to do.

1434
01:35:24.672 --> 01:35:26.074
<v Larry Augustin>In many ways, I look back, and

1435
01:35:26.555 --> 01:35:30.988
<v Larry Augustin>I've said I'm something of a hack
when it comes to being able to

1436
01:35:31.048 --> 01:35:34.802
<v Larry Augustin>create things in code, and I'm
super proud that I think I've been

1437
01:35:34.842 --> 01:35:37.891
<v Larry Augustin>able to support and help some
people who are just brilliant that

1438
01:35:37.931 --> 01:35:44.630
<v Larry Augustin>have created some technology that
makes the world better for

1439
01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:44.930
<v Larry Augustin>everyone.

1440
01:35:47.475 --> 01:35:48.336
<v Larry Augustin>There's a little bit for you.

1441
01:35:49.582 --> 01:35:55.014
<v Elisabetta Mori>And is there anything if you had
your time again you would do

1442
01:35:55.114 --> 01:36:00.608
<v Elisabetta Mori>differently?
You know, it's hard to say

1443
01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:06.061
<v Larry Augustin>because, you know, as I look back
now, I realize how naive I was at

1444
01:36:06.121 --> 01:36:14.292
<v Larry Augustin>every stage, but that's how we
learn.

1445
01:36:16.455 --> 01:36:21.988
<v Larry Augustin>So I'm not big on the would have,
should have, could have done it

1446
01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:22.769
<v Larry Augustin>differently.

1447
01:36:22.789 --> 01:36:25.715
<v Larry Augustin>I think everyone has to go through

1448
01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:35.622
<v Larry Augustin>the learning phases, and there's a
ton of things that I got wrong all

1449
01:36:35.682 --> 01:36:36.083
<v Larry Augustin>the time.

1450
01:36:36.504 --> 01:36:41.852
<v Larry Augustin>There's a ton of, but I listened a

1451
01:36:41.892 --> 01:36:45.543
<v Larry Augustin>lot, and I hope I learned from
those, and I hope I don't, you

1452
01:36:45.563 --> 01:36:48.352
<v Larry Augustin>know, I hope I've learned along
the way, and that I get better,

1453
01:36:48.372 --> 01:36:49.741
<v Larry Augustin>and I can impart some of that
knowledge.

1454
01:36:50.784 --> 01:36:53.451
<v Larry Augustin>But I also believe people also
have to go through some of that.

1455
01:36:53.532 --> 01:36:56.746
<v Larry Augustin>So this is a little of my
philosophy when I advise

1456
01:36:56.826 --> 01:36:57.789
<v Larry Augustin>entrepreneurs and companies.

1457
01:36:57.829 --> 01:36:59.173
<v Larry Augustin>I give them advice, but I also

1458
01:36:59.194 --> 01:37:03.127
<v Larry Augustin>think they have to learn
themselves, and people make

1459
01:37:03.167 --> 01:37:03.668
<v Larry Augustin>mistakes.

1460
01:37:06.133 --> 01:37:07.415
<v Larry Augustin>That's part of the learning

1461
01:37:07.455 --> 01:37:07.856
<v Larry Augustin>process.

1462
01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.043
<v Larry Augustin>It's one of the things I think is

1463
01:37:09.063 --> 01:37:16.146
<v Larry Augustin>great about the Silicon Valley
culture is that it's a culture in

1464
01:37:16.206 --> 01:37:20.134
<v Larry Augustin>which people learn from making
mistakes, and you can make a

1465
01:37:20.154 --> 01:37:22.824
<v Larry Augustin>mistake, and get better, and
learn, and come back, and that's

1466
01:37:22.904 --> 01:37:23.265
<v Larry Augustin>okay.

1467
01:37:25.730 --> 01:37:28.175
<v Larry Augustin>So that's how I think about,

1468
01:37:28.681 --> 01:37:30.069
<v Larry Augustin>that's how I think about that
question.

1469
01:37:34.524 --> 01:37:39.293
<v Elisabetta Mori>So what's your relationship with
the community, you know, free and

1470
01:37:39.373 --> 01:37:43.185
<v Elisabetta Mori>open source community, like what's
your relationship with old

1471
01:37:43.266 --> 01:37:50.406
<v Elisabetta Mori>acquaintances like Dolman,
Torvalds, Mad Dog Hall?

1472
01:37:50.606 --> 01:37:54.815
<v Larry Augustin>I was on the Clinics Foundation
Board of Directors for a long

1473
01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:55.276
<v Larry Augustin>time.

1474
01:37:55.276 --> 01:37:59.227
<v Larry Augustin>I was an early person who helped

1475
01:37:59.568 --> 01:38:02.453
<v Larry Augustin>get that organization going.

1476
01:38:02.854 --> 01:38:04.701
<v Larry Augustin>I work with a lot of open source

1477
01:38:04.881 --> 01:38:06.163
<v Larry Augustin>entrepreneurs today.

1478
01:38:06.183 --> 01:38:09.889
<v Larry Augustin>I love that community.

1479
01:38:09.909 --> 01:38:15.042
<v Larry Augustin>I don't spend as much time online
as I used to.

1480
01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:20.495
<v Larry Augustin>Now there's more time for family
and other things in my life.

1481
01:38:23.304 --> 01:38:27.934
<v Larry Augustin>But I still spend a lot of time,
if you look at the angel investing

1482
01:38:27.974 --> 01:38:32.927
<v Larry Augustin>and places where I go, I spend a
lot of time with people there, and

1483
01:38:32.967 --> 01:38:37.596
<v Larry Augustin>it's just been fantastic and
lucky, and I've loved it.

1484
01:38:39.904 --> 01:38:44.033
<v Elisabetta Mori>Maybe we already covered this a
little bit because, you know, we

1485
01:38:44.053 --> 01:38:47.926
<v Elisabetta Mori>were talking about learning from,
you know, errors and mistakes that

1486
01:38:48.087 --> 01:38:51.800
<v Elisabetta Mori>one can go through, but what
advice would you give to someone

1487
01:38:52.281 --> 01:38:58.811
<v Elisabetta Mori>willing to pursue your career?
I would say a couple of things.

1488
01:39:00.353 --> 01:39:03.000
<v Larry Augustin>One is pursue things that you
love.

1489
01:39:04.804 --> 01:39:06.126
<v Larry Augustin>I think that's very important.

1490
01:39:06.687 --> 01:39:08.972
<v Larry Augustin>I have always made decisions for

1491
01:39:09.032 --> 01:39:15.708
<v Larry Augustin>me about doing things that I
personally thought were important

1492
01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:19.596
<v Larry Augustin>or loved or enjoyed or wanted to
be involved with.

1493
01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:30.095
<v Larry Augustin>Not because I thought I could make
money doing that, and I don't know

1494
01:39:30.135 --> 01:39:31.137
<v Larry Augustin>if that's great advice.

1495
01:39:32.202 --> 01:39:33.024
<v Larry Augustin>It's worked for me.

1496
01:39:33.866 --> 01:39:34.848
<v Larry Augustin>I'll just say that.

1497
01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:37.434
<v Larry Augustin>I have been lucky that it's left

1498
01:39:37.454 --> 01:39:40.905
<v Larry Augustin>me in a position where I can
continue to do more of that, and I

1499
01:39:40.965 --> 01:39:42.428
<v Larry Augustin>think there's something to that.

1500
01:39:44.994 --> 01:39:46.401
<v Larry Augustin>Pursuing things for passion, I

1501
01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:52.333
<v Larry Augustin>think, brings you a certain depth
to them that pursuing them just

1502
01:39:52.373 --> 01:39:55.927
<v Larry Augustin>for money doesn't, so I always
encourage that.

1503
01:39:55.947 --> 01:39:58.114
<v Larry Augustin>I always encourage learning.

1504
01:40:03.044 --> 01:40:04.407
<v Larry Augustin>You know, I go back to kind of my

1505
01:40:04.427 --> 01:40:08.796
<v Larry Augustin>early life where I told the story,
you know, you're in the field and

1506
01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:09.642
<v Larry Augustin>the tractor breaks.

1507
01:40:09.662 --> 01:40:10.824
<v Larry Augustin>I don't know anything about

1508
01:40:10.864 --> 01:40:15.374
<v Larry Augustin>tractors, but I can figure it out,
you know.

1509
01:40:15.855 --> 01:40:16.341
<v Larry Augustin>I'll try it.

1510
01:40:16.401 --> 01:40:17.203
<v Larry Augustin>What's the worst case?

1511
01:40:17.263 --> 01:40:19.509
<v Larry Augustin>It's broken already, you know.

1512
01:40:19.609 --> 01:40:20.853
<v Larry Augustin>Maybe I'll break it more, but

1513
01:40:20.913 --> 01:40:25.267
<v Larry Augustin>maybe I'll fix it, and by the way,
if I don't fix it, I don't know

1514
01:40:25.307 --> 01:40:31.104
<v Larry Augustin>who is, so it's okay to dive into
things that you don't know, and

1515
01:40:31.244 --> 01:40:35.135
<v Larry Augustin>maybe you'll learn something along
the way and improve things.

1516
01:40:40.865 --> 01:40:42.930
<v Larry Augustin>I really encourage people with
this.

1517
01:40:43.551 --> 01:40:49.686
<v Larry Augustin>I worry sometimes that our society
in some ways has become too

1518
01:40:49.726 --> 01:40:58.404
<v Larry Augustin>cautious around people, you know,
willing to just fix or figure out

1519
01:40:58.464 --> 01:41:03.735
<v Larry Augustin>or dive in and solve a problem,
and I encourage people.

1520
01:41:05.283 --> 01:41:05.884
<v Larry Augustin>You don't know.

1521
01:41:07.908 --> 01:41:08.629
<v Larry Augustin>You don't know how to do

1522
01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:09.110
<v Larry Augustin>something.

1523
01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:12.096
<v Larry Augustin>It's okay, you know, but by the

1524
01:41:12.116 --> 01:41:15.488
<v Larry Augustin>way, you'll probably make
mistakes, you know, figuring it

1525
01:41:15.608 --> 01:41:18.535
<v Larry Augustin>out, but don't let that stop you.

1526
01:41:21.005 --> 01:41:24.872
<v Larry Augustin>Try, learn, dive into things.

1527
01:41:26.055 --> 01:41:27.698
<v Larry Augustin>Many of the things I've done in my
career, I didn't know what I was

1528
01:41:27.698 --> 01:41:27.828
<v Larry Augustin>doing when I started, but things
I've done in my career, I didn't

1529
01:41:27.828 --> 01:41:28.905
<v Larry Augustin>know what I was doing when I
started, but I listened, I

1530
01:41:28.925 --> 01:41:43.235
<v Larry Augustin>learned, and ultimately,
ultimately, I helped create things

1531
01:41:43.255 --> 01:41:47.220
<v Larry Augustin>that were better, and I learned a
lot and educated a lot and

1532
01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.879
<v Larry Augustin>educated myself in that, so take
those risks.

1533
01:41:52.231 --> 01:41:55.039
<v Elisabetta Mori>Is there anything you would like
to add that we haven't covered

1534
01:41:55.079 --> 01:41:59.874
<v Elisabetta Mori>today?
This has been a great,

1535
01:41:59.994 --> 01:42:01.979
<v Larry Augustin>wide-ranging discussion, and I
want to thank you.

1536
01:42:01.979 --> 01:42:02.835
<v Elisabetta Mori>Okay, so thank you.

1537
01:42:03.022 --> 01:42:03.840
<v Larry Augustin>Thank you, Elisabetta.

1538
01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.065
<v Larry Augustin>And it's been a real pleasure
talking to you today.

1539
01:42:06.406 --> 01:42:07.769
<v Larry Augustin>Thank you very much.

1540
01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:10.261
<v Elisabetta Mori>Thank you.
