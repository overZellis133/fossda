1
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.300
<v Heather Meeker>Okay, I think we're going.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Heather Meeker>All right.

3
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Heather Meeker>Hello.

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Heather Meeker>I am very happy today to be

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.054
<v Heather Meeker>talking to Bruce Perens, who is
one of the founders of the Open

6
00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:28.691
<v Heather Meeker>Source movement and who created
the 'open source' definition.

7
00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:32.800
<v Heather Meeker>You know, it's impossible to
catalog all of Bruce's

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Heather Meeker>achievements in a short
introduction and to most in the

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.784
<v Heather Meeker>open source world, he doesn't need
any introduction.

10
00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Heather Meeker>But I'll mention a couple of
things.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Heather Meeker>He's the creator of BusyBox, which
is a key software utility for

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.200
<v Heather Meeker>Linux system that everybody uses
all the time, and he was a key

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.392
<v Heather Meeker>developer at Pixar, helping to
create the technology of 3D

14
00:00:55.392 --> 00:00:57.207
<v Heather Meeker>animated feature films.

15
00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Heather Meeker>Bruce, welcome to FOSSDA!

16
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Bruce Perens>Well, thank you very much,
Heather.

17
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.600
<v Heather Meeker>So glad that you're willing to
take the time to talk to me today.

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.261
<v Heather Meeker>So, I'd like to know what got you
involved in open source?

19
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Heather Meeker>How'd you decide to get involved
in/create this movement of open

20
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Heather Meeker>source?
Well, obviously, I'm standing on

21
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.915
<v Bruce Perens>the shoulders of giants because
the work of Richard Stallman

22
00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Bruce Perens>preceeded mine, and the basic
concepts of open source are those

23
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Bruce Perens>created by Richard for free
software.

24
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Bruce Perens>What we did with open source was
create a marketing program for the

25
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Bruce Perens>free software concept which would
reach different people.

26
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Bruce Perens>So, Richard's approach was very
well suited for programmers, but

27
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Bruce Perens>it depended on the apriori
understanding of the usefulness of

28
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Bruce Perens>software freedom.

29
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.900
<v Bruce Perens>And our approach was more based on

30
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.407
<v Bruce Perens>just having a big collection of
software that you could build,

31
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.892
<v Bruce Perens>whether it was a business or any
project that you wanted to, you

32
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Bruce Perens>could build these upon, you could
share the development of the

33
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Bruce Perens>software and my feeling personally
was that the philosophy would come

34
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Bruce Perens>later for a lot of the people who
participated.

35
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Bruce Perens>And so, obviously, we were
successful beyond our wildest

36
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Bruce Perens>dreams.

37
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Bruce Perens>We took over, essentially, the

38
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.469
<v Bruce Perens>software industry.

39
00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.076
<v Bruce Perens>Open source is everywhere.

40
00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Bruce Perens>Whether you understand it or not,
you encounter it in your life all

41
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Bruce Perens>day.

42
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Bruce Perens>And so, that has been very

43
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.800
<v Bruce Perens>fulfilling.

44
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Bruce Perens>We did not achieve all of our

45
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.500
<v Bruce Perens>goals.

46
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Bruce Perens>Actually, I would have liked it if

47
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.800
<v Bruce Perens>people did appreciate the need for
software freedom, which is

48
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.700
<v Bruce Perens>something that is becoming more
meaningful today, especially in

49
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Bruce Perens>the context of privacy and people
seeing the large web companies, as

50
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.300
<v Bruce Perens>sort of privacy eating giants,
don't really have your best

51
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.454
<v Bruce Perens>interest in mind.

52
00:03:36.454 --> 00:03:42.107
<v Bruce Perens>And open source, though very

53
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.700
<v Bruce Perens>successful, I think, has evolved a
extremely capable open source,

54
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.100
<v Bruce Perens>exploitation industry.

55
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Bruce Perens>So, I'm not quite so happy about

56
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.123
<v Bruce Perens>that, I actually am working on
solutions.

57
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Heather Meeker>Well, so, tell me at the very
beginning - and by the way, I kind

58
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Heather Meeker>of know some of the answer to this
because you and I have known each

59
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Heather Meeker>other for a long time but - Yeah
but we have an audience so let's

60
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.261
<v Bruce Perens>conquer that!
Yeah, right!

61
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.716
<v Heather Meeker>How did you actually get involved
in the development of open source?

62
00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:21.800
<v Heather Meeker>What was the motivation for doing
that in the first place?

63
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:32.700
<v Bruce Perens>Well, I had been a Unix systems
programmer since 1981 and that was

64
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.907
<v Bruce Perens>at the lab that was the
predecessor of Pixar.

65
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.153
<v Bruce Perens>It was at New York Tech, a
otherwise not-very-memorable

66
00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:48.200
<v Bruce Perens>college, that had the computer
graphics laboratory - almost a

67
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.537
<v Bruce Perens>hobby of the chancellor of this
college, the late Alexander Schure

68
00:04:52.537 --> 00:05:01.800
<v Bruce Perens>- and we were creating 3D feature
character animation in that

69
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Bruce Perens>laboratory.

70
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.500
<v Bruce Perens>A lot of the people went on to

71
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Bruce Perens>Pixar, also many other places -
Disney, Dreamworks, all over.

72
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:20.100
<v Bruce Perens>And so, I was into Unix and
eventually went to work for Pixar.

73
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:29.000
<v Bruce Perens>And one day, I actually sat across
from Steve Jobs' office, not

74
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.400
<v Bruce Perens>because I was important, I think
they wanted to keep an eye on me.

75
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.600
<v Bruce Perens>And so, one day, Steve made his
peace with Bill Gates and where

76
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.900
<v Bruce Perens>there had been a NeXT workstation
on Steve's desk, there was now a

77
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:56.969
<v Bruce Perens>Windows laptop and for a time at
Pixar, Steve felt that computing

78
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Bruce Perens>would just all turn to Microsoft
Windows and I have asserted down

79
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.600
<v Bruce Perens>on that.

80
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Bruce Perens>I didn't actually think of it as a

81
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.800
<v Bruce Perens>very capable system, especially at
the time because Microsoft didn't

82
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Bruce Perens>have competition that would give
it a strong quality incentive like

83
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
<v Bruce Perens>they have now.

84
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Bruce Perens>And so, Linux started to come

85
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.015
<v Bruce Perens>along because of a number of
factors.

86
00:06:27.015 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Bruce Perens>The Canoe project had developed
all of what we call runtime.

87
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.700
<v Bruce Perens>So all of the programs that would
run on it, and the libraries for

88
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Bruce Perens>the most part were a product of
the Canoe project - but the Canoe

89
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.600
<v Bruce Perens>project was not successful in
developing a kernel, which is the

90
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Bruce Perens>part that connects the hardware
and the software - and so, Linus

91
00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.261
<v Bruce Perens>Torvalds came along and made a
successful kernel.

92
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Bruce Perens>At the start it didn't have
networking, you know, people don't

93
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Bruce Perens>remember the Linux didn't actually
work on the net successfully for

94
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:19.900
<v Bruce Perens>quite a while and people started
to create Linux distributions and

95
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.300
<v Bruce Perens>there were a number of for-profit
ones, most of which no one has

96
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.600
<v Bruce Perens>ever heard of today.

97
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.700
<v Bruce Perens>And Ian Murdock saw this happening

98
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.500
<v Bruce Perens>and said, well, let's create a
non-profit one and he created

99
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Bruce Perens>Debian which most people actually
know through Ubuntu today and I

100
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.500
<v Bruce Perens>joined, I guess, there must have
been 50 people on the whole

101
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.500
<v Bruce Perens>project at the time, and
eventually became the Debian

102
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.556
<v Bruce Perens>project leader.

103
00:07:56.556 --> 00:07:59.400
<v Bruce Perens>Ian went on to other things and

104
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:08.300
<v Bruce Perens>took the project and did something
that no one knew was possible at

105
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Bruce Perens>that time, which was that Ian had
made all of the core of the

106
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:19.000
<v Bruce Perens>project, everything that it needed
to boot and run and install

107
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Bruce Perens>packages, had been produced by
Ian.

108
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:30.600
<v Bruce Perens>And I took it and obviously didn't
have the time to work on all of

109
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:38.500
<v Bruce Perens>these packages and fanned them out
to 50 people who I only knew from

110
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.900
<v Bruce Perens>email correspondence on the net.

111
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.200
<v Bruce Perens>I was a Debian project leader, I

112
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:51.700
<v Bruce Perens>had never actually met another
Debian developer, and fanned it

113
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Bruce Perens>out.

114
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.800
<v Bruce Perens>And these 50 people who also did

115
00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:04.515
<v Bruce Perens>not physically know each other
combined to create a working,

116
00:09:04.515 --> 00:09:07.261
<v Bruce Perens>running, operating system.

117
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:11.900
<v Bruce Perens>And obviously, the software was

118
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.446
<v Bruce Perens>very modular and that certainly
helped us get away with that but

119
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.800
<v Bruce Perens>also the fact that open source let
us all sort of look over each

120
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.900
<v Bruce Perens>other's shoulders and help each
other was very useful as well.

121
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:33.500
<v Bruce Perens>So all of these people who had no
common employer, who hadn't met at

122
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:41.200
<v Bruce Perens>that time, and who really only had
their own private goals driving

123
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Bruce Perens>this - I think, at that point,
none of them were actually doing

124
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.600
<v Bruce Perens>this for their employer - combined
to create a working operating

125
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.200
<v Bruce Perens>system that among other things,
flew on the space shuttle

126
00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:00.800
<v Bruce Perens>controlling an experiment, was
very, very successful.

127
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:07.300
<v Bruce Perens>And most of the work that we did
at that time survives in the Linux

128
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Bruce Perens>system that you are using today,
some of it in your Android

129
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.676
<v Bruce Perens>telephones.

130
00:10:12.676 --> 00:10:16.400
<v Bruce Perens>Because I wrote BusyBox, BusyBox

131
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Bruce Perens>was the installer.

132
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Bruce Perens>The whole idea of BusyBox is it's

133
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.100
<v Bruce Perens>all of the commands that you might
need to install an operating

134
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:34.300
<v Bruce Perens>system on a computer made smaller
so that they all would fit on a

135
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Bruce Perens>floppy disk.

136
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.400
<v Bruce Perens>Okay, that's how far back this

137
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:37.900
<v Bruce Perens>goes.

138
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.400
<v Bruce Perens>We had those three-and-a-half inch

139
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Bruce Perens>plastic floppy disks and the
kernel fit on one and all of the

140
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.100
<v Bruce Perens>runtime and BusyBox fit on the
second one.

141
00:10:52.600 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Bruce Perens>And so, you would boot your system
using these two floppy disks and

142
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.000
<v Bruce Perens>then you would be able to put a CD
in the CD drive and install the

143
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.500
<v Bruce Perens>entire distribution from it.

144
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.300
<v Bruce Perens>I don't think we even had bootable

145
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.907
<v Bruce Perens>CD at that point.

146
00:11:11.907 --> 00:11:15.038
<v Bruce Perens>And if you didn't have a CD, we

147
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.000
<v Bruce Perens>also had a way to make rather
large collection of floppy disks,

148
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Bruce Perens>and you would also just keep
feeding floppies into your

149
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.523
<v Bruce Perens>computer until you had a system
installed.

150
00:11:28.523 --> 00:11:34.900
<v Bruce Perens>You know, going back this far, I
think I had 240 megabyte hard

151
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Bruce Perens>drives on the computer I was using
for development.

152
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:45.500
<v Bruce Perens>So, thats actually practical to
feed this all with that amount of

153
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:54.900
<v Bruce Perens>floppies, and this worked!
And I, actually, for all of the

154
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.400
<v Bruce Perens>work that other people have done
upon it and all of the legal

155
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Bruce Perens>issues, which later popped up, I
worked on BusyBox for an entire

156
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.500
<v Bruce Perens>month and I never touched it
again.

157
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:19.924
<v Bruce Perens>I created about 35 programs in
that month and subsequent to that,

158
00:12:19.924 --> 00:12:25.200
<v Bruce Perens>it was adopted by a series of
other programmers who made

159
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.300
<v Bruce Perens>tremendous improvements to it, but
I actually checked and my code is

160
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.200
<v Bruce Perens>still in it.

161
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:37.400
<v Bruce Perens>And I used the GPL license, and

162
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:43.500
<v Bruce Perens>the GPL license is a
share-and-share-alike license and

163
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.100
<v Bruce Perens>thus, if you made improvements to
this program, you had to share the

164
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.830
<v Bruce Perens>improvement.

165
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.800
<v Bruce Perens>So my original investment of a

166
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.300
<v Bruce Perens>month of evenings I should have
been spending with my wife,

167
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:06.300
<v Bruce Perens>really, was tremendously,
tremendously expanded by the

168
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.700
<v Bruce Perens>subsequent work of all of these
people which they did under the

169
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:16.800
<v Bruce Perens>GPL license contribute when in
some cases the incentive for them

170
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Bruce Perens>would have been to keep their
modifications private.

171
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Bruce Perens>So we had two embedded systems-
companies that decided to make

172
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:32.500
<v Bruce Perens>embedded Linux and deal it to a
number of commercial companies

173
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.069
<v Bruce Perens>that were putting it on various
kinds of hardware.

174
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:40.200
<v Bruce Perens>And one of them was Linio and I
don't even remember the name of

175
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.000
<v Bruce Perens>the other now.

176
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
<v Bruce Perens>And those companies achieved a six

177
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.500
<v Bruce Perens>months time to market lead by
using my software rather than

178
00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.400
<v Bruce Perens>creating their own and this was in
terms of- it might have taken some

179
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.800
<v Bruce Perens>of their guys that long to add all
of the software and make it all

180
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Bruce Perens>work.

181
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.600
<v Bruce Perens>And so they built on my software

182
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:18.700
<v Bruce Perens>and the software became much much
larger, got up above a hundred and

183
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Bruce Perens>thirty commands.

184
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.854
<v Heather Meeker>So bigger than a floppy disk?

185
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:33.000
<v Bruce Perens>Yeah and essentially a small but
capable command line system that

186
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.600
<v Bruce Perens>you could do many different things
with.

187
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:47.100
<v Bruce Perens>And so, that system became part of
a lot of Android telephones, of

188
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:55.800
<v Bruce Perens>part of wireless access points, if
you use- well, the open source

189
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Bruce Perens>project OpenWrt uses it.

190
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.792
<v Bruce Perens>Then many commercial, wireless

191
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Bruce Perens>access point designs are derived
from that.

192
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.200
<v Bruce Perens>For example, there are very many
embedded devices for the most

193
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.400
<v Bruce Perens>mundane uses - aquarium
temperature controllers that all

194
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.800
<v Bruce Perens>have this software in them, and
webcams, all kinds of things.

195
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:31.900
<v Bruce Perens>And so, for something that I spent
a month upon, I did not ever

196
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Bruce Perens>receive financial compensation
directly from it, but it has tens

197
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.800
<v Bruce Perens>and hundreds of millions of users.

198
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:44.600
<v Bruce Perens>All right.

199
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:51.692
<v Bruce Perens>Users who don't necessarily even
know that it exists but there is

200
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Bruce Perens>some pride in that, just as an
artist likes to have their

201
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.300
<v Bruce Perens>paintings appreciated, a
programmer likes to have lots of

202
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.100
<v Bruce Perens>users and lots of things happening
with their software.

203
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:11.400
<v Bruce Perens>And today, I know that a jet plane
does not fly without using BusyBox

204
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:17.500
<v Bruce Perens>and you don't, you probably don't
wake up and get into your day

205
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.015
<v Bruce Perens>without using BusyBox.

206
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.200
<v Bruce Perens>And so, that's really fun and it

207
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.600
<v Bruce Perens>was worth that months of evenings
and Valerie and I are still

208
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.800
<v Bruce Perens>together even though I probably
neglected her for that whole

209
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.200
<v Bruce Perens>month.

210
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:40.500
<v Bruce Perens>And so, we didn't receive direct

211
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Bruce Perens>payment for this, but I did
receive a great deal of notoriety

212
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:53.600
<v Bruce Perens>which has led to a lot of other
opportunities.

213
00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:02.100
<v Bruce Perens>One of the most fun was I was in a
commercial for IBM Linux after

214
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.746
<v Bruce Perens>they bought Red Hat.

215
00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.099
<v Bruce Perens>I think this was actually a

216
00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:13.200
<v Bruce Perens>mistake that the casting person
cast me and then I think there was

217
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.574
<v Bruce Perens>quite a to-do within IBM because
they would have vastly preferred

218
00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:26.500
<v Bruce Perens>to cast someone from Red Hat, but
I ended up being the face of Linux

219
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:34.500
<v Bruce Perens>for IBM for a good eight months
and actually IBM's conference that

220
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:34.900
<v Bruce Perens>year.

221
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.600
<v Bruce Perens>They opened with an extended video

222
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.700
<v Bruce Perens>from the commercial.

223
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.800
<v Bruce Perens>So, the conference opens and the

224
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:48.000
<v Bruce Perens>very first thing that people see
is my face and I got fifty

225
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.309
<v Bruce Perens>thousand dollars for a couple
hours work.

226
00:17:50.309 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Bruce Perens>You know, Hollywood is that way
when you're successful and I'm

227
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.800
<v Bruce Perens>sure it's very, very difficult
when you're not.

228
00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:05.800
<v Bruce Perens>And so that was one of the things
but I've had most of my employment

229
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.900
<v Bruce Perens>and consulting opportunities are
connected to this work that I did

230
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:19.200
<v Bruce Perens>- oh gee, now it's coming up on 30
years ago - and so that's just

231
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.200
<v Bruce Perens>been great fun.

232
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Bruce Perens>Obviously, I have some regrets

233
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:32.000
<v Bruce Perens>over the way that things have come
out, but it's been incredibly more

234
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.300
<v Bruce Perens>successful than anyone could have
ever asked so those things are

235
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.400
<v Bruce Perens>very tempered.

236
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.650
<v Bruce Perens>So, that's probably enough for one

237
00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:41.800
<v Bruce Perens>question.

238
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.000
<v Heather Meeker>Well, that's really great.

239
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.600
<v Heather Meeker>Thank you.

240
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.946
<v Heather Meeker>I mean, you were doing this all

241
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.600
<v Heather Meeker>during the time you were still
working at Pixar, isn't that

242
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.754
<v Heather Meeker>right?
Yeah, I was working at Pixar and,

243
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.354
<v Bruce Perens>as I said, I worked for Steve
Jobs.

244
00:18:59.354 --> 00:19:02.469
<v Bruce Perens>Not directly, I had managers.

245
00:19:02.469 --> 00:19:05.746
<v Bruce Perens>There was Ed Catmull, the CEO, who

246
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.207
<v Bruce Perens>now, I guess, is a CEO of Disney,
if he's still there.

247
00:19:10.207 --> 00:19:19.000
<v Bruce Perens>And I was a Systems Programmer for
Imaging for the most part so I

248
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.200
<v Bruce Perens>invented image composing language
and did a great deal of work for

249
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.600
<v Bruce Perens>them.

250
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.600
<v Bruce Perens>But one of the things I noticed

251
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:34.900
<v Bruce Perens>was that, for the most part, my
work for Pixar, all end of life

252
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Bruce Perens>while I was still working there,
was replaced with something else.

253
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.900
<v Bruce Perens>And of course, when you make
software for a movie, we go on to

254
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.800
<v Bruce Perens>the next movie and we don't always
use the same software.

255
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:55.200
<v Bruce Perens>And, so, during this time, Pixar
made their IPO, which was very

256
00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.400
<v Bruce Perens>useful because I had enough money
from the IPO to pay off my

257
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:07.000
<v Bruce Perens>mortgage and I could be a flake
because unlike everybody else in

258
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:12.700
<v Bruce Perens>Silicon Valley, I didn't have this
incredible mortgage that I would

259
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.600
<v Bruce Perens>take many, many years to pay off.

260
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.500
<v Bruce Perens>And so, I could work full-time on

261
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.200
<v Bruce Perens>open source and, you know, see
where the money came in, which it

262
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.100
<v Bruce Perens>usually did.

263
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.400
<v Bruce Perens>And so, I remember at the time

264
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Bruce Perens>someone saying to me "well, Pixar
is having its IPO and you have Toy

265
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:45.000
<v Bruce Perens>Story coming out, and isn't this
wonderful?" And at the time, the

266
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.800
<v Bruce Perens>space shuttle had just launched
with Debian Linux and the

267
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.800
<v Bruce Perens>biosciences project on it and I
said well, you know, it's cool to

268
00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:02.600
<v Bruce Perens>have a movie in theaters and to
have an IPO that's being very

269
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Bruce Perens>successful but my hobby project is
orbiting in space and that's

270
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Bruce Perens>actually more fulfilling to me.

271
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.300
<v Bruce Perens>And I remember actually finding

272
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.000
<v Bruce Perens>out that this would happen.

273
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.800
<v Bruce Perens>The way it happened was, someone

274
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:27.200
<v Bruce Perens>wrote to me, someone who I did not
know, and I was at my desk at

275
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.161
<v Bruce Perens>Pixar and and said, can I boot
Debian on a serial console?

276
00:21:31.376 --> 00:21:37.200
<v Bruce Perens>And I had never done this because
I had only developed on desktops

277
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.400
<v Bruce Perens>that had VGA cards at the time,
you know, lower resolution

278
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.569
<v Bruce Perens>graphical displays.

279
00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:47.200
<v Bruce Perens>And I said, well, that's

280
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.700
<v Bruce Perens>interesting and I have on my desk
here at Pixar, would I need to

281
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.807
<v Bruce Perens>test that?
So, I took 15 minutes from Pixar,

282
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Bruce Perens>and I tested it and took another
15 minutes and documented my

283
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.600
<v Bruce Perens>changes back to back out so I
could get back to my work at Pixar

284
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:17.000
<v Bruce Perens>and wrote back to the Sky
Sebastian Kuznetsky and said

285
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.346
<v Bruce Perens>here's what you need to do.

286
00:22:18.346 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Bruce Perens>And he wrote back and said that

287
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.500
<v Bruce Perens>works great, this is going on the
next space shuttle.

288
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:31.400
<v Bruce Perens>And so, you know, imagine me at my
desk at Pixar with my jaw now

289
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:39.800
<v Bruce Perens>unhinged and on the floor
somewhere and I got up and I

290
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.900
<v Bruce Perens>walked all around the building
looking for someone to tell this

291
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.146
<v Bruce Perens>to.

292
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.300
<v Bruce Perens>And the only person who understood

293
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:55.200
<v Bruce Perens>about Linux was Loren Carpenter, a
very famous computer graphic

294
00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.938
<v Bruce Perens>person, and Loren was working from
home that day so that there was no

295
00:23:00.938 --> 00:23:05.100
<v Bruce Perens>one at Pixar I could tell this to
who would have a clue of what was

296
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.607
<v Bruce Perens>happening and not think I was
crazy.

297
00:23:07.607 --> 00:23:12.561
<v Bruce Perens>And that kind of decided me that
Pixar wasn't really my future.

298
00:23:12.561 --> 00:23:20.900
<v Bruce Perens>And there had been other things
they had actually restarted

299
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.100
<v Bruce Perens>vesting from zero and I'd been
there for eight years, which was

300
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.400
<v Bruce Perens>kind of annoying.

301
00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.854
<v Bruce Perens>And so I, at that point, you know,

302
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.100
<v Bruce Perens>said to myself, I'm going to have
to work for this company 12 years

303
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.207
<v Bruce Perens>to be vested in my stock.

304
00:23:38.207 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Bruce Perens>And Pixar had actually gone

305
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.800
<v Bruce Perens>bankrupt once or twice on the way
to success and Steve had funded

306
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.861
<v Bruce Perens>them out of pocket.

307
00:23:47.861 --> 00:23:53.400
<v Bruce Perens>His advisor, his financial

308
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.700
<v Bruce Perens>advisor, told him, you know, you
probably shouldn't do this again,

309
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Bruce Perens>but he gave us another chance.

310
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.300
<v Bruce Perens>And so, essentially, the day after

311
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:12.800
<v Bruce Perens>I was fully vested after 12 years
at Pixar, I left and went to work

312
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:20.100
<v Bruce Perens>for my first venture capital
operation was called Linux Capital

313
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.800
<v Bruce Perens>group and it was not successful;
I'm in another unsuccessful one

314
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.300
<v Bruce Perens>today.

315
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:32.500
<v Bruce Perens>And so, I worked for them for a

316
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:43.800
<v Bruce Perens>while and that did not work out
and then I left that company

317
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.000
<v Bruce Perens>essentially so that they would not
have to pay me and they'd be able

318
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.776
<v Bruce Perens>to keep Progeny Linux systems,
which was Ian's company, afloat.

319
00:24:52.776 --> 00:24:58.800
<v Bruce Perens>That worked for 7 years, but they
eventually closed that one, too.

320
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:07.200
<v Bruce Perens>And so, I went to work for
Hewlett-Packard as Senior Global

321
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.400
<v Bruce Perens>Strategist of Linux and Open
Source and that was all because of

322
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:16.538
<v Bruce Perens>the notoriety that I had
accumulated as, you know, an open

323
00:25:16.538 --> 00:25:19.200
<v Bruce Perens>source spokesperson and developer.

324
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:27.300
<v Bruce Perens>So, I remember leaving Pixar and

325
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.100
<v Bruce Perens>walked into Steve's office and,
you know, there were a lot of

326
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.607
<v Bruce Perens>stories about Steve.

327
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.500
<v Bruce Perens>Steve was never nasty to me and

328
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.100
<v Bruce Perens>probably because I got there
first.

329
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:48.100
<v Bruce Perens>I was a pretty obnoxious guy, you
know, still am in many ways, and I

330
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.300
<v Bruce Perens>was very aggressive.

331
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.600
<v Bruce Perens>And so I think that Steve and I

332
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.500
<v Bruce Perens>were sort of on the same
wavelength in that regard.

333
00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:03.800
<v Bruce Perens>And so I walked in and he knew I
was leaving and I said "You still

334
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:11.144
<v Bruce Perens>don't believe in this Linux stuff"
and Steve, you know, Mr. Ego, said

335
00:26:11.144 --> 00:26:18.500
<v Bruce Perens>to me "Well, I've been involved in
creating two of the three great

336
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.054
<v Bruce Perens>operating systems" - and by that,
he meant, Mac OS and NeXTSTEP -

337
00:26:23.054 --> 00:26:31.600
<v Bruce Perens>"and all of them took a
billion-dollar laboratory and I

338
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.000
<v Bruce Perens>don't think that you can get over
the hump because you don't have

339
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.730
<v Bruce Perens>the billion-dollar laboratory".

340
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.300
<v Bruce Perens>And so, you know, shook Steve's

341
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.469
<v Bruce Perens>hand, said goodbye.

342
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Bruce Perens>Never actually communicated with

343
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.415
<v Bruce Perens>Steve, again.

344
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.800
<v Bruce Perens>I sent him one or two emails and

345
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Bruce Perens>never got a reply.

346
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.800
<v Bruce Perens>He wasn't one to talk to

347
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.584
<v Bruce Perens>ex-employees.

348
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:58.400
<v Bruce Perens>And a year later though, Steve got

349
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.400
<v Bruce Perens>on stage at Macworld and
introduced the Safari browser.

350
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:12.200
<v Bruce Perens>And the Safari browser was
graphical web browser based on the

351
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.415
<v Bruce Perens>KDE Open Source Graphics Project.

352
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.700
<v Bruce Perens>So the point there was that

353
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Bruce Perens>graphics developed by open source
had already exceeded what they

354
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.207
<v Bruce Perens>could do inside Apple.

355
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.600
<v Bruce Perens>And that Apple was leveraging upon

356
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.800
<v Bruce Perens>it in order to get a leg up on the
web browser development, which

357
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.800
<v Bruce Perens>they were kind of behind on at
that point, and if you ask me,

358
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.207
<v Bruce Perens>they're still behind today.

359
00:27:40.207 --> 00:27:47.300
<v Bruce Perens>And so, Steve stood on the stage

360
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:53.400
<v Bruce Perens>at Macworld in front of a huge
slide saying "Open Source, We Love

361
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.900
<v Bruce Perens>It" and although Steve never
acknowledged it, I won that

362
00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.800
<v Bruce Perens>argument.

363
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.515
<v Bruce Perens>Come on, Heather!

364
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.500
<v Heather Meeker>Well, that's one of those things
like 'revenge is a dish best

365
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.900
<v Heather Meeker>served cold', something like that.

366
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.400
<v Heather Meeker>Not exactly revenge, but

367
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.878
<v Heather Meeker>everybody, I guess, comes around
to open source eventually.

368
00:28:17.878 --> 00:28:21.361
<v Heather Meeker>It's just a matter of how long it
takes them to do that, right?

369
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.154
<v Bruce Perens>Ah. Yeah, I mean, back then was
when Craig Mundie had said Linux

370
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Bruce Perens>is a virus, it will steal your
intellectual property.

371
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Bruce Perens>And today, obviously, Microsoft is
part of the open-source

372
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.800
<v Bruce Perens>exploitation industry.

373
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.400
<v Bruce Perens>They're not just using it for

374
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:50.000
<v Bruce Perens>their health but they are
participants in open source to a

375
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.100
<v Bruce Perens>degree that no one at Microsoft or
outside would have believed when

376
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.600
<v Bruce Perens>this all started.

377
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.646
<v Bruce Perens>And that's what really gets me is,

378
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Bruce Perens>so many things have happened that
no one would have believed.

379
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.600
<v Bruce Perens>And mostly because the economics,
though real, was not intuitive.

380
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:24.600
<v Bruce Perens>And so, if I had said to you, I'm
going to get together with my

381
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:30.500
<v Bruce Perens>friends who I've never met on the
internet and develop an

382
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.961
<v Bruce Perens>encyclopedia and it's going to put
Encyclopedia Britannica out of

383
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.600
<v Bruce Perens>business so far that they don't
even make the printed version

384
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.469
<v Bruce Perens>anymore, you would have said
"You're on drugs, Bruce".

385
00:29:43.469 --> 00:29:49.703
<v Bruce Perens>And, you know, if I'd said I'm
going to make an operating system

386
00:29:49.703 --> 00:29:56.400
<v Bruce Perens>that essentially takes over the
industry, they would have said the

387
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.169
<v Bruce Perens>same thing and all of these
happened.

388
00:30:00.169 --> 00:30:04.400
<v Bruce Perens>And without boring people to
tears, there's a paper I wrote

389
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:10.261
<v Bruce Perens>about this called "The Emerging
Economic Paradigm of Open Source"

390
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:15.800
<v Bruce Perens>and it's 15 years old and still
current, and if you want to

391
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.700
<v Bruce Perens>understand the economics, read
that.

392
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.200
<v Heather Meeker>Yeah, it's really- it's been an
amazing journey for everybody.

393
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.161
<v Heather Meeker>I think that maybe for you, more
than most people.

394
00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:35.900
<v Heather Meeker>You know, I'd like to ask a little
bit more about like, what what was

395
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.900
<v Heather Meeker>it like collaborating with 50
people you didn't know?

396
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.554
<v Heather Meeker>I mean, you said that was
considered impossible at the time.

397
00:30:43.554 --> 00:30:48.307
<v Heather Meeker>Now, I think, people probably
almost take it as a given?

398
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:55.400
<v Heather Meeker>I'd like to know your thoughts
about how how that came about, why

399
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Heather Meeker>it worked, some cases where it
didn't work - whatever you'd like

400
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.800
<v Heather Meeker>to talk about about sort of the
community aspect of it.

401
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:10.700
<v Bruce Perens>Um, I think that the software
collaboration was very successful.

402
00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:16.600
<v Bruce Perens>A lot of the organizational
efforts were not.

403
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:22.900
<v Bruce Perens>For example, during this time, I
drove the creation of software in

404
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:28.000
<v Bruce Perens>the public interest, non-profit
that's still very active in

405
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Bruce Perens>supporting open source projects,
and there was vast distrust among

406
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.669
<v Bruce Perens>the Debian developers of software
in the public interest.

407
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:53.200
<v Bruce Perens>And I think that it would have
been legally advantageous for the

408
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:59.300
<v Bruce Perens>developers to be working on behalf
of this non-profit which would

409
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:05.076
<v Bruce Perens>actually take up the liability
because they were individuals, and

410
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.954
<v Bruce Perens>if they got sued, they were out of
the game.

411
00:32:07.954 --> 00:32:14.200
<v Bruce Perens>And software in the public
interest would probably have been

412
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.800
<v Bruce Perens>able if it were sued to get help
from kind people like you.

413
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:28.200
<v Bruce Perens>And so, this was vastly distrusted
by the developers and, you know,

414
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.200
<v Bruce Perens>it was a non-profit.

415
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.600
<v Bruce Perens>I wasn't about to take the money

416
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.600
<v Bruce Perens>and pocket it or even pay myself.

417
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.300
<v Bruce Perens>So the reasons for it really

418
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:40.954
<v Bruce Perens>escape me.

419
00:32:40.954 --> 00:32:46.200
<v Bruce Perens>So there were failures like that,

420
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:53.400
<v Bruce Perens>but in general, if you were just
making software, everybody was

421
00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:00.700
<v Bruce Perens>willing to give a hand in making
software and at that time, I think

422
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.646
<v Bruce Perens>email communication felt natural
to us.

423
00:33:03.646 --> 00:33:10.900
<v Bruce Perens>And there's actually an
interesting but somewhat creepy

424
00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:18.200
<v Bruce Perens>aspect of it, which is, we don't
really like to admit that a great

425
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:25.800
<v Bruce Perens>many of us programmers are on the
spectrum, and are very capable and

426
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:32.000
<v Bruce Perens>had very successful lives, but may
have been a little debilitated

427
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Bruce Perens>with regard to personal
interaction.

428
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.800
<v Bruce Perens>And many of these people are
actually more comfortable

429
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:46.900
<v Bruce Perens>collaborating with the community
entirely textually, not looking at

430
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.100
<v Bruce Perens>their faces, not having to parse
their voice tone.

431
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:58.900
<v Bruce Perens>And to some degree, that may have
actually helped us and it's

432
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.000
<v Bruce Perens>actually sad that for the most
part those people cannot

433
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:09.699
<v Bruce Perens>collaborate in that way any longer
that the technology is improved to

434
00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.000
<v Bruce Perens>the point that you and I are
looking at each other's faces

435
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.900
<v Bruce Perens>again, where we at the time, would
not have heard each other's voice

436
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.600
<v Bruce Perens>and would not have seen each
other.

437
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Heather Meeker>Yeah, I think that's very
interesting that there's a kind of

438
00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:31.699
<v Heather Meeker>temporal disconnect and personal
disconnect that's possible in

439
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.454
<v Heather Meeker>these asynchronous, like,
development platforms and so forth

440
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.000
<v Heather Meeker>that work very well for some
people.

441
00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:48.300
<v Bruce Perens>Yeah, and also, if you're one of
these programmers who has some

442
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:55.600
<v Bruce Perens>social issues, computing is a very
comfortable environment for you

443
00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:02.800
<v Bruce Perens>because your computer doesn't
dislike you and not work with you

444
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.554
<v Bruce Perens>because it doesn't like your face.

445
00:35:04.554 --> 00:35:08.200
<v Bruce Perens>Your program runs if it's correct,

446
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.600
<v Bruce Perens>and it doesn't run until it's
correct.

447
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:17.400
<v Bruce Perens>And so these were the, that was
also something that was very

448
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:22.600
<v Bruce Perens>comfortable for the kind of person
who really does like to stay in

449
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:28.800
<v Bruce Perens>their cube and code, and, you
know, do their work with the world

450
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.300
<v Bruce Perens>that way.

451
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.300
<v Bruce Perens>Now, I sort of bridged both of

452
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.400
<v Bruce Perens>those worlds.

453
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Bruce Perens>I think people know this by now, I

454
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.884
<v Bruce Perens>am not neurotypical.

455
00:35:40.884 --> 00:35:46.000
<v Bruce Perens>And so I have some of those

456
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Bruce Perens>issues, but I'm also very, very
well trained.

457
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.500
<v Bruce Perens>While I think it might have been
better at the time to put me in

458
00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.700
<v Bruce Perens>speech therapy, my schools didn't
have that.

459
00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:04.154
<v Bruce Perens>So they just put me in rhetoric
class every year.

460
00:36:04.154 --> 00:36:09.900
<v Bruce Perens>And so, I had, you know,
practically an hour of public

461
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:16.600
<v Bruce Perens>speech practice every day, for
perhaps a decade of my life, and

462
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:23.300
<v Bruce Perens>came out of this a really good
public speaker and was able to

463
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:30.300
<v Bruce Perens>evangelize this stuff where other
people might not have.

464
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:36.900
<v Bruce Perens>And, in fact, I actually have the
opposite of the fear of public

465
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.500
<v Bruce Perens>speaking.

466
00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.600
<v Bruce Perens>I have a fear of being in

467
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:46.300
<v Bruce Perens>audiences because I will feel so
strongly about a subject that I'll

468
00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.354
<v Bruce Perens>be tempted to argue with the
speaker, and actually have.

469
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.600
<v Bruce Perens>So I'm actually more comfortable
if I'm up there talking and that

470
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Bruce Perens>probably doesn't say good things
about me.

471
00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:08.200
<v Heather Meeker>Well, you certainly have been a
beloved advocate for all these

472
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.300
<v Heather Meeker>years and I think it's very
interesting that some of that came

473
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:17.300
<v Heather Meeker>out of dealing with a challenge,
you know, but you you were able to

474
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.500
<v Heather Meeker>turn it to something that
benefitted everyone.

475
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.645
<v Bruce Perens>An actual, actual physical
handicap.

476
00:37:20.645 --> 00:37:26.900
<v Bruce Perens>I cound not talk clearly, I could
not move the way other people

477
00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:27.300
<v Bruce Perens>moved.

478
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.700
<v Bruce Perens>And, you know, these things, you

479
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:35.000
<v Bruce Perens>can, sometimes, age out of them,
but it was a great part of what

480
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.100
<v Bruce Perens>made me, what I am.

481
00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.300
<v Heather Meeker>Well, that's really great.

482
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:45.224
<v Heather Meeker>So anything else you'd like to
share before we wrap up?

483
00:37:45.224 --> 00:37:48.800
<v Heather Meeker>This has been a fascinating
conversation and even though I've

484
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.600
<v Heather Meeker>known you for a long time, always
really like hearing about your

485
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.800
<v Heather Meeker>story over again, or, you know, or
different aspects of it.

486
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.500
<v Heather Meeker>Anything else you'd like to share
before we stop?

487
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:11.500
<v Bruce Perens>Well, I think that this is a kind
of success that other people don't

488
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:18.300
<v Bruce Perens>always achieve and I would
encourage everyone to follow their

489
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.000
<v Bruce Perens>dreams, work on what you love to
the extent that you can.

490
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.100
<v Bruce Perens>I mean, don't make your family
broke.

491
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:32.500
<v Bruce Perens>But sometimes, you can achieve
these things and internet

492
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:38.400
<v Bruce Perens>collaboration has made so much
more of this possible.

493
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:43.100
<v Bruce Perens>And that was something that I
really touched upon it.

494
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:50.500
<v Bruce Perens>That time, no one understood all
of the implications that there

495
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:56.200
<v Bruce Perens>were projects, that at the time,
people just would have been

496
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.300
<v Bruce Perens>considered nuts for working on.

497
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Bruce Perens>But when you have 50 nuts who

498
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.400
<v Bruce Perens>believe the same as you on the
internet, you're more powerful

499
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.400
<v Bruce Perens>than any startup company.

500
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.400
<v Bruce Perens>And so, today you can achieve

501
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.400
<v Bruce Perens>incredible things and I would
encourage everyone to give that a

502
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:20.700
<v Bruce Perens>try.

503
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.600
<v Bruce Perens>See if they can do it.

504
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Heather Meeker>That's great.

505
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.100
<v Heather Meeker>Well, thanks so much, Bruce.

506
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:30.330
<v Heather Meeker>I really appreciate your talking
to me today and contributing this

507
00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:30.984
<v Heather Meeker>to FOSSDA.

508
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.300
<v Bruce Perens>Thanks very much, Heather.

509
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.050
<v Heather Meeker>Okay, bye bye.

510
00:39:36.125 --> 00:39:36.162
<v Bruce Perens>Bye Bye!
