00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:04.442
<v Karen Herman>Hello, today is April 21st in the
year 2023.

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.323
<v Karen Herman>I'm Karen Herman and I am
delighted to be interviewing Deb

3
00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Karen Herman>Goodkin for the Free and Open
Source Stories Digital Archive.

4
00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:14.663
<v Karen Herman>So welcome and thank you so much
for doing this.

5
00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:17.172
<v Karen Herman>I'm very excited to be doing this
with you today.

6
00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Karen Herman>And we're going to start right
from the beginning, which is when

7
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.907
<v Karen Herman>and where were you born?
Oh, well, I was born in Hollywood,

8
00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:26.668
<v Deb Goodkin>California.

9
00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:28.678
<v Deb Goodkin>And I was born in 1961.

10
00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:34.004
<v Karen Herman>And where did you grow up?
So I grew up in Southern

11
00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:34.625
<v Deb Goodkin>California.

12
00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:37.592
<v Deb Goodkin>And so half my childhood was in

13
00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:38.434
<v Deb Goodkin>Los Angeles.

14
00:00:38.694 --> 00:00:40.322
<v Deb Goodkin>And then we moved to San Diego,

15
00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:41.585
<v Deb Goodkin>which was great.

16
00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:44.572
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and lived there until I

17
00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:45.775
<v Deb Goodkin>graduated from college.

18
00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:48.691
<v Karen Herman>What did your parents do?

19
00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:54.673
<v Deb Goodkin>So my dad, it was always really
hard to understand what he did.

20
00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:58.486
<v Deb Goodkin>None of us kids really interested
in it, not like he was in the CIA

21
00:00:58.546 --> 00:00:58.987
<v Deb Goodkin>or anything.

22
00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:02.095
<v Deb Goodkin>But he, he basically was in real

23
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.009
<v Deb Goodkin>estate, but helping large
developers develop, like larger

24
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.791
<v Deb Goodkin>communities.

25
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:14.441
<v Deb Goodkin>And so he did that, as long as I

26
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:19.512
<v Deb Goodkin>knew, and was like, sort of known
as an expert in that.

27
00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.424
<v Deb Goodkin>And I worked for him when I was in
high school, when I was in

28
00:01:22.464 --> 00:01:25.581
<v Deb Goodkin>college, and he actually thought I
would take over the business from

29
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:25.841
<v Deb Goodkin>him.

30
00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:29.449
<v Deb Goodkin>And my mom worked until she had

31
00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:29.870
<v Deb Goodkin>kids.

32
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:32.655
<v Deb Goodkin>And she wanted to be a doctor, and

33
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.586
<v Deb Goodkin>she would have been a great
doctor, but she was a

34
00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:36.829
<v Deb Goodkin>bacteriologist.

35
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.701
<v Deb Goodkin>And a lot of it was just because

36
00:01:39.742 --> 00:01:40.305
<v Deb Goodkin>of the times.

37
00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:43.818
<v Karen Herman>And do you have any brothers or

38
00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:44.149
<v Karen Herman>sisters?
I have two older brothers.

39
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:55.891
<v Karen Herman>And what kind of kid were you?
Um, Um, I guess if I think about

40
00:01:55.931 --> 00:02:00.399
<v Karen Herman>that, I, um, I don't know if it
was because I had brothers, but I

41
00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:02.529
<v Karen Herman>was very outdoorsy.

42
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.854
<v Karen Herman>And I always remember us kids just

43
00:02:04.894 --> 00:02:06.578
<v Karen Herman>playing outside all the time.

44
00:02:06.598 --> 00:02:08.769
<v Karen Herman>And I think growing up in Southern

45
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.696
<v Karen Herman>California, I mean, the weather
was always beautiful.

46
00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Karen Herman>And so you could do that.

47
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.344
<v Karen Herman>And we had a swimming pool at

48
00:02:13.484 --> 00:02:13.624
<v Karen Herman>home.

49
00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:16.009
<v Karen Herman>And so we in the summers, we swam.

50
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.827
<v Karen Herman>And I always remember my oldest
brother was into filming.

51
00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:26.817
<v Karen Herman>So he had this old camera, and
then he would set us up, we would

52
00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:28.445
<v Karen Herman>do like war scenes, all sorts of
things that we would play

53
00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:28.686
<v Karen Herman>together.

54
00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:37.348
<v Karen Herman>And so I think as a kid, I would

55
00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:39.032
<v Karen Herman>have been referred to as a tomboy.

56
00:02:39.132 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Karen Herman>But really, I mean, to me, that's

57
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.331
<v Karen Herman>just like being a kid, just being,
you know, curious and active.

58
00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:49.544
<v Karen Herman>And, because when one of my
brothers was much older than me,

59
00:02:51.107 --> 00:02:55.255
<v Karen Herman>he would take me backpacking and
river rafting and things like

60
00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:55.515
<v Karen Herman>that.

61
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.671
<v Karen Herman>So, so it was a good childhood.

62
00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.672
<v Karen Herman>Did you have any idea what you
wanted to be when you grew up?

63
00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:05.886
<v Deb Goodkin>I wanted.. there are a lot of
things I wanted to be.

64
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.729
<v Deb Goodkin>And I think that's what made it
hard.

65
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.885
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and my parents, they never
encouraged me to be anything, but

66
00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.269
<v Deb Goodkin>they never limited it.

67
00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.873
<v Deb Goodkin>So they never made me feel like

68
00:03:15.893 --> 00:03:17.602
<v Deb Goodkin>there was anything I couldn't do.

69
00:03:17.702 --> 00:03:19.846
<v Deb Goodkin>So I mean, I went from wanting to

70
00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:25.200
<v Deb Goodkin>be an astronaut to a veterinarian
to, you know, I thought about

71
00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:26.262
<v Deb Goodkin>being a doctor.

72
00:03:26.282 --> 00:03:31.611
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so, you know, so, so it was

73
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:36.102
<v Deb Goodkin>nice being able to think about it
or knowing I had those options.

74
00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:41.473
<v Deb Goodkin>And but, but it took time
narrowing down, you know, where,

75
00:03:41.693 --> 00:03:42.655
<v Deb Goodkin>where I thought I should go.

76
00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.450
<v Karen Herman>Did, did you have any interest in

77
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.547
<v Karen Herman>computing or computers as a kid?
So, um, we didn't have a computer

78
00:03:53.807 --> 00:03:54.508
<v Deb Goodkin>when I was growing up.

79
00:03:54.548 --> 00:03:57.113
<v Deb Goodkin>So that was before home computers.

80
00:03:57.393 --> 00:04:02.867
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I really, the only thing I
knew about computers was really

81
00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:06.734
<v Deb Goodkin>the word processors, which were
fancy typewriters.

82
00:04:06.874 --> 00:04:10.244
<v Deb Goodkin>And because my dad was also a
writer, we had one at home.

83
00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:11.627
<v Deb Goodkin>And so that was pretty novel.

84
00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:15.815
<v Deb Goodkin>And but, but I didn't grow up with

85
00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:16.295
<v Deb Goodkin>computers.

86
00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:17.582
<v Deb Goodkin>So I didn't know anything, I

87
00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:19.105
<v Deb Goodkin>really didn't know anything about
them.

88
00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:25.083
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so it really wasn't until
I went to college that I was

89
00:04:25.183 --> 00:04:26.385
<v Deb Goodkin>exposed to computers.

90
00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.149
<v Deb Goodkin>So really, before that, I mean,

91
00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.821
<v Deb Goodkin>part of my growing up, and maybe
because I had brothers too, I

92
00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:36.751
<v Deb Goodkin>built a lot of things, I was
really into, like building models,

93
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:41.145
<v Deb Goodkin>and we would build like, model
cars and model airplanes and

94
00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:41.867
<v Deb Goodkin>things like that.

95
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.772
<v Deb Goodkin>So I've always enjoyed that

96
00:04:43.832 --> 00:04:44.474
<v Deb Goodkin>building things.

97
00:04:46.267 --> 00:04:47.251
<v Karen Herman>And where did you go to college?

98
00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:51.628
<v Deb Goodkin>I went to University of California
in San Diego, and for my

99
00:04:51.688 --> 00:04:56.402
<v Deb Goodkin>undergrad, and then I went to
University of Santa Clara, up in

100
00:04:57.326 --> 00:04:58.612
<v Deb Goodkin>Santa Clara, California.

101
00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:00.009
<v Karen Herman>And what did you study?

102
00:05:01.182 --> 00:05:04.509
<v Deb Goodkin>So for my undergrad, it was
computer engineering, which was,

103
00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:09.262
<v Deb Goodkin>at that time, it was part computer
science and part electrical

104
00:05:09.402 --> 00:05:09.964
<v Deb Goodkin>engineering.

105
00:05:10.284 --> 00:05:12.028
<v Deb Goodkin>And then for my master's degree, I

106
00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.715
<v Deb Goodkin>got a master's in electrical
engineering.

107
00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:18.289
<v Karen Herman>It's interesting, because you said
that you really didn't have, you

108
00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:20.341
<v Karen Herman>didn't know anything about
computers till you got to college.

109
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:23.833
<v Karen Herman>How did you then decide to major
in it?

110
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:26.324
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, I mean, that's a really good
question.

111
00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:31.355
<v Deb Goodkin>Because when I started college,
actually, I was focused more on

112
00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:36.187
<v Deb Goodkin>business, because like I said,
before, the plan was really for me

113
00:05:36.227 --> 00:05:37.649
<v Deb Goodkin>to take over my dad's business.

114
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.896
<v Deb Goodkin>But it wasn't something I was

115
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.921
<v Deb Goodkin>really interested in.

116
00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:46.587
<v Deb Goodkin>And my mom actually helped me try

117
00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:48.551
<v Deb Goodkin>to figure out what I was good at.

118
00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:51.916
<v Deb Goodkin>And I grew up thinking, never

119
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.668
<v Deb Goodkin>thinking I was good at math, but
my mom would always tell me how

120
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.112
<v Deb Goodkin>she was good at math.

121
00:05:57.332 --> 00:05:58.495
<v Deb Goodkin>I don't even know why it would

122
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Deb Goodkin>come up.

123
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.244
<v Deb Goodkin>But I knew that I knew my mom was

124
00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:01.765
<v Deb Goodkin>good at math.

125
00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I realized that I was also

126
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.251
<v Deb Goodkin>very good at math.

127
00:06:05.752 --> 00:06:09.202
<v Deb Goodkin>And so in doing like an assessment

128
00:06:09.242 --> 00:06:13.770
<v Deb Goodkin>test at that time, computer
science, and engineering actually

129
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:15.794
<v Deb Goodkin>came up as a strength.

130
00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:17.401
<v Deb Goodkin>And I thought, you know what, I,

131
00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:20.688
<v Deb Goodkin>this would be a great major,
because I could get a job.

132
00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.243
<v Deb Goodkin>And so that was really why I went
in that direction.

133
00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:27.512
<v Karen Herman>And was there something specific
that you studied?

134
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:34.490
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, Um, well, actually, I was
really, so in the computer

135
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.877
<v Deb Goodkin>engineering, you get a lot of, you
know, computer science theory, and

136
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.867
<v Deb Goodkin>like understanding algorithms, and
you learn a lot of different

137
00:06:42.907 --> 00:06:47.261
<v Deb Goodkin>programming languages from, we
actually started with punch cards,

138
00:06:47.522 --> 00:06:49.105
<v Deb Goodkin>just to check them out.

139
00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:51.228
<v Deb Goodkin>So I mean, at that time, you had

140
00:06:51.288 --> 00:06:53.092
<v Deb Goodkin>Pascal and Fortran and BASIC.

141
00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:56.101
<v Deb Goodkin>And we did, we wrote an assembly

142
00:06:56.141 --> 00:07:01.471
<v Deb Goodkin>language, we wrote compilers, so a
lot of software development, and

143
00:07:01.592 --> 00:07:04.421
<v Deb Goodkin>as well as understanding theory,
but also electrical engineering

144
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:10.251
<v Deb Goodkin>side, so circuits and in all in
the typical types of classes that

145
00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:15.864
<v Deb Goodkin>you would get in electrical
engineering, I took math all four

146
00:07:15.884 --> 00:07:20.651
<v Deb Goodkin>years, just because, as an
elective, just because I was good

147
00:07:20.672 --> 00:07:20.772
<v Deb Goodkin>at it.

148
00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:24.423
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so I made sure I always

149
00:07:24.463 --> 00:07:25.227
<v Deb Goodkin>took a math class.

150
00:07:28.203 --> 00:07:31.988
<v Karen Herman>And so then you went to graduate

151
00:07:32.028 --> 00:07:32.329
<v Karen Herman>school.

152
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.692
<v Karen Herman>Again, was there was there

153
00:07:34.993 --> 00:07:37.942
<v Karen Herman>something that you wanted to do
specifically, at that point?

154
00:07:38.881 --> 00:07:43.207
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so I didn't plan to go to grad
school after I graduated.

155
00:07:43.908 --> 00:07:49.676
<v Deb Goodkin>When I joined IBM, it was a time
when they actually were hiring a

156
00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:53.164
<v Deb Goodkin>lot of new college graduates.

157
00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so when I started IBM, and

158
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.435
<v Deb Goodkin>we had, I don't know how many,
maybe there's 10, eight or 10 of

159
00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:07.210
<v Deb Goodkin>us that were all new, and, and IBM
offered to pay for your tuition to

160
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.911
<v Deb Goodkin>go to grad school.

161
00:08:08.392 --> 00:08:10.255
<v Deb Goodkin>So we all considered doing it.

162
00:08:10.415 --> 00:08:14.145
<v Deb Goodkin>And the choice really was between
Stanford and University of Santa

163
00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:17.151
<v Deb Goodkin>Clara, because both universities
were right there.

164
00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:22.925
<v Deb Goodkin>And I actually chose University of
Santa Clara, because they had a

165
00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:26.571
<v Deb Goodkin>new storage focus.

166
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:28.614
<v Deb Goodkin>So it was the first time any

167
00:08:28.714 --> 00:08:31.823
<v Deb Goodkin>university that I knew of was
actually teaching about storage

168
00:08:31.863 --> 00:08:35.530
<v Deb Goodkin>devices and that type of
technology, which made sense,

169
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.501
<v Deb Goodkin>because IBM, so I worked for IBM,
that's what what we did there.

170
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.069
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so and actually, Santa
Clara Valley was growing into sort

171
00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:48.354
<v Deb Goodkin>of a storage focused area.

172
00:08:48.374 --> 00:08:51.001
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so that was my focus, even

173
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:52.544
<v Deb Goodkin>though it was electrical
engineering.

174
00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:56.453
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and it was really just, you
know, to have that degree under my

175
00:08:56.493 --> 00:08:59.182
<v Deb Goodkin>belt, and the fact that IBM paid
for it.

176
00:08:59.603 --> 00:09:04.092
<v Deb Goodkin>And actually, you could finish
your last quarter semester as a

177
00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:07.024
<v Deb Goodkin>full time student, and you still
get got your salary at the time.

178
00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:08.410
<v Deb Goodkin>So it was a pretty good deal.

179
00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:11.350
<v Karen Herman>Well, and where were the offices

180
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.706
<v Karen Herman>at IBM?
They're in South San Jose.

181
00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:18.070
<v Deb Goodkin>And that campus is gone.

182
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.612
<v Deb Goodkin>When I go there, I don't, I don't

183
00:09:19.672 --> 00:09:21.455
<v Deb Goodkin>even recognize anything anymore.

184
00:09:21.616 --> 00:09:22.724
<v Deb Goodkin>It was a large campus, though.

185
00:09:24.325 --> 00:09:27.622
<v Karen Herman>And you were working with storage?
I was working storage.

186
00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:33.591
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, I, so it's not like now
where you have a disk drive on

187
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:35.414
<v Deb Goodkin>your desk, and you actually see
it.

188
00:09:35.655 --> 00:09:41.207
<v Deb Goodkin>They were in big cabinets in on
the, in the computer rooms, and in

189
00:09:41.788 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Deb Goodkin>those air conditioned rooms.

190
00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:45.373
<v Deb Goodkin>And so rarely would I actually go

191
00:09:45.534 --> 00:09:46.095
<v Deb Goodkin>and look at it.

192
00:09:46.195 --> 00:09:48.181
<v Deb Goodkin>But so I worked on a, you know, a

193
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:52.808
<v Deb Goodkin>small component of, of the storage
device.

194
00:09:53.569 --> 00:09:57.795
<v Deb Goodkin>And I also, so I did some
firmware, or we called it

195
00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:02.845
<v Deb Goodkin>microcode there, and, and also
went into hardware development,

196
00:10:02.946 --> 00:10:04.328
<v Deb Goodkin>doing logic design.

197
00:10:04.468 --> 00:10:07.833
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so I focused on the ECC,

198
00:10:07.913 --> 00:10:10.520
<v Deb Goodkin>the error correct, error
correction code.

199
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.749
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and that was a really nice
opportunity, because one of the

200
00:10:16.789 --> 00:10:21.516
<v Deb Goodkin>main architects of ECC, of the ECC
there at IBM was working in our

201
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.046
<v Deb Goodkin>group, and I got to work under,
under him.

202
00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:25.048
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I learned a lot.

203
00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:27.414
<v Deb Goodkin>So it was a great opportunity.

204
00:10:30.568 --> 00:10:35.125
<v Karen Herman>What year was that?
Oh, I don't know.

205
00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:37.869
<v Deb Goodkin>That was, so I joined IBM in 1984.

206
00:10:37.869 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Karen Herman>Okay.

207
00:10:40.153 --> 00:10:43.818
<v Deb Goodkin>And I worked for them for like
three years, maybe.

208
00:10:45.848 --> 00:10:47.712
<v Karen Herman>What was the state of storage at
that time?

209
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:52.705
<v Karen Herman>So different?
So, um, storage.

210
00:10:53.466 --> 00:10:56.930
<v Deb Goodkin>So I don't know, I don't remember
how much you could store on those

211
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.592
<v Deb Goodkin>large storage devices.

212
00:10:59.313 --> 00:11:02.557
<v Deb Goodkin>But, um, I mean, these were

213
00:11:02.597 --> 00:11:04.563
<v Deb Goodkin>storage devices storage devices
for large computers.

214
00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:10.892
<v Deb Goodkin>So companies like, you know, like
HP would use, well, they had their

215
00:11:10.972 --> 00:11:11.633
<v Deb Goodkin>own computers.

216
00:11:12.114 --> 00:11:14.417
<v Deb Goodkin>But, you know, basically, you, the

217
00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:20.189
<v Deb Goodkin>the the the customer would have
like an IBM 360 computer, which is

218
00:11:20.249 --> 00:11:21.431
<v Deb Goodkin>also a big cabinet.

219
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:22.733
<v Deb Goodkin>And then they would have the

220
00:11:22.753 --> 00:11:24.195
<v Deb Goodkin>storage that would go with it.

221
00:11:24.876 --> 00:11:28.443
<v Deb Goodkin>When I was at IBM, the first PCs

222
00:11:28.804 --> 00:11:29.725
<v Deb Goodkin>were coming out.

223
00:11:29.865 --> 00:11:33.290
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so we actually got those

224
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.451
<v Deb Goodkin>to use for development.

225
00:11:34.792 --> 00:11:38.596
<v Deb Goodkin>And the first PC had a floppy

226
00:11:38.616 --> 00:11:41.163
<v Deb Goodkin>drive, I don't think we had any
hard storage on it.

227
00:11:41.644 --> 00:11:44.529
<v Deb Goodkin>But I always remember getting my
first disk drive that was five

228
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:48.056
<v Deb Goodkin>megabytes, which is nothing now.

229
00:11:49.461 --> 00:11:51.964
<v Deb Goodkin>It was so much and then it doubled

230
00:11:52.364 --> 00:11:54.747
<v Deb Goodkin>to we went to 10 megabytes.

231
00:11:54.867 --> 00:12:00.214
<v Deb Goodkin>But, but it was so cool to be able

232
00:12:00.234 --> 00:12:04.762
<v Deb Goodkin>to have your own computer with
your own storage that you could

233
00:12:04.842 --> 00:12:07.145
<v Deb Goodkin>save your own files to.

234
00:12:08.146 --> 00:12:10.530
<v Deb Goodkin>And so the the disk drives we

235
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:16.038
<v Deb Goodkin>worked on at IBM, those were 14
inch platters or just, you know,

236
00:12:16.038 --> 00:12:16.321
<v Deb Goodkin>just size.

237
00:12:16.321 --> 00:12:16.341
<v Deb Goodkin>just size.

238
00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:20.428
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so once you had the
personal computer, those were five

239
00:12:20.468 --> 00:12:20.989
<v Deb Goodkin>and a quarter.

240
00:12:22.011 --> 00:12:23.493
<v Deb Goodkin>So typically, if you see a disk

241
00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:26.843
<v Deb Goodkin>drive, then it's it's usually like
the older ones are five and a

242
00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:27.264
<v Deb Goodkin>quarter.

243
00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:28.726
<v Deb Goodkin>I don't know your know, if you can

244
00:12:28.746 --> 00:12:29.508
<v Deb Goodkin>get those anymore.

245
00:12:29.528 --> 00:12:32.133
<v Deb Goodkin>Nowadays, if you're still getting,

246
00:12:32.153 --> 00:12:37.084
<v Deb Goodkin>you know, rotational disk, then
it's it's three and a half or two,

247
00:12:37.104 --> 00:12:38.146
<v Deb Goodkin>two and a half.

248
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.612
<v Deb Goodkin>So, you know, so they just kept

249
00:12:42.632 --> 00:12:43.293
<v Deb Goodkin>getting smaller.

250
00:12:43.313 --> 00:12:47.324
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and larger storage, as you

251
00:12:47.364 --> 00:12:49.271
<v Deb Goodkin>know, now, they're in the
terabytes.

252
00:12:52.327 --> 00:12:55.863
<v Karen Herman>How long were you there at IBM?
I think I was there for three

253
00:12:55.903 --> 00:12:56.123
<v Deb Goodkin>years.

254
00:12:57.004 --> 00:13:00.129
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so it wasn't, it wasn't real

255
00:13:00.169 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Deb Goodkin>long.

256
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.613
<v Deb Goodkin>And at that time, you when you

257
00:13:02.653 --> 00:13:05.901
<v Deb Goodkin>joined IBM, you're a lifer, you
people didn't leave IBM.

258
00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:09.087
<v Deb Goodkin>And I mean, and they took care of
you.

259
00:13:09.127 --> 00:13:10.971
<v Deb Goodkin>And so there was really no reason
to leave.

260
00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:14.701
<v Deb Goodkin>But it's also when Silicon Valley
was just coming alive.

261
00:13:15.122 --> 00:13:21.250
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so when you work for IBM,
you were paid the same.

262
00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:25.840
<v Deb Goodkin>It didn't matter where you, you
lived in San Jose and the whole

263
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.082
<v Deb Goodkin>Bay Area was a pretty expensive
place to live.

264
00:13:28.823 --> 00:13:37.574
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so I thought I could do
better financially.

265
00:13:37.594 --> 00:13:40.761
<v Deb Goodkin>Another company was one of the
other startups.

266
00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:45.289
<v Deb Goodkin>And there were quite a few storage
companies starting out in that

267
00:13:45.409 --> 00:13:45.830
<v Deb Goodkin>area.

268
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.953
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I went, that's when I, I

269
00:13:48.013 --> 00:13:48.935
<v Deb Goodkin>left IBM.

270
00:13:49.316 --> 00:13:51.002
<v Deb Goodkin>And really, that was the time

271
00:13:51.022 --> 00:13:53.566
<v Deb Goodkin>others started leaving IBM too.

272
00:13:54.047 --> 00:13:56.911
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so I think it was just how

273
00:13:56.951 --> 00:14:01.423
<v Deb Goodkin>things were, you know, changing at
the time with, with, you know, the

274
00:14:01.684 --> 00:14:04.533
<v Deb Goodkin>emergence of this whole Silicon
Valley.

275
00:14:07.066 --> 00:14:10.636
<v Karen Herman>What did you, what was the thing
that you learned the most about at

276
00:14:10.697 --> 00:14:14.266
<v Karen Herman>IBM?
At IBM, it gave me a really good

277
00:14:14.326 --> 00:14:16.649
<v Deb Goodkin>foundation on how to develop code.

278
00:14:17.109 --> 00:14:20.354
<v Deb Goodkin>And so you didn't really have like

279
00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:23.618
<v Deb Goodkin>a hacking mentality then, like you
have now.

280
00:14:23.618 --> 00:14:27.427
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and, and that's fine, too.

281
00:14:27.447 --> 00:14:28.869
<v Deb Goodkin>It's just that you really had to

282
00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:31.313
<v Deb Goodkin>think through, what are you trying
to do?

283
00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:34.438
<v Deb Goodkin>And then how are you going to do
that?

284
00:14:34.598 --> 00:14:41.811
<v Deb Goodkin>And then, And then, as like a
junior level engineer, I would

285
00:14:41.851 --> 00:14:44.715
<v Deb Goodkin>actually, so I'd have to come up
with my plan or my design.

286
00:14:44.915 --> 00:14:48.183
<v Deb Goodkin>And then you actually had a design
that you hand wrote.

287
00:14:48.203 --> 00:14:50.045
<v Deb Goodkin>So it wasn't a programming
language yet.

288
00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:53.691
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so we actually refer to
it as pseudocode.

289
00:14:54.332 --> 00:14:59.764
<v Deb Goodkin>And then you would actually meet
with others, your colleagues, and,

290
00:14:59.784 --> 00:15:02.508
<v Deb Goodkin>and people would review your
design.

291
00:15:02.748 --> 00:15:05.854
<v Deb Goodkin>And so you wouldn't actually
implement it until it got

292
00:15:05.954 --> 00:15:06.515
<v Deb Goodkin>approved.

293
00:15:06.595 --> 00:15:08.701
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so it was a great way to learn

294
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:13.289
<v Deb Goodkin>because if someone saw like a hole
in that, or even a, you know, a

295
00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:16.033
<v Deb Goodkin>better way to do something, you
would learn from that.

296
00:15:16.474 --> 00:15:23.527
<v Deb Goodkin>And so taking that time to think
through, you know, what, really,

297
00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:27.052
<v Deb Goodkin>what are you trying to achieve?
And then how can you get there?

298
00:15:27.233 --> 00:15:31.742
<v Deb Goodkin>I, that was a good skill to have,
and philosophy to have.

299
00:15:32.624 --> 00:15:37.311
<v Deb Goodkin>Also working with others to learn
how to collaborate with others.

300
00:15:37.351 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, you learn that in school,
but, but now, you know, you have a

301
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.681
<v Deb Goodkin>real product.

302
00:15:42.302 --> 00:15:43.805
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and the way IBM worked back

303
00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:46.930
<v Deb Goodkin>then, too, is sometimes you had
competing teams.

304
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:55.046
<v Deb Goodkin>And so they had the money to fund,
like, similar teams, you didn't

305
00:15:55.126 --> 00:15:55.747
<v Deb Goodkin>always know it.

306
00:15:56.348 --> 00:15:58.131
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so whoever came out with

307
00:15:58.171 --> 00:16:00.214
<v Deb Goodkin>better product, you know,
basically won.

308
00:16:00.575 --> 00:16:03.082
<v Deb Goodkin>You didn't look at it like that,
basically, they would cancel your

309
00:16:03.102 --> 00:16:05.846
<v Deb Goodkin>product, project, and you'd move
on to something else.

310
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.156
<v Deb Goodkin>So, because things were so new,
back then, too.

311
00:16:12.396 --> 00:16:17.286
<v Deb Goodkin>So you didn't, there was so much
possibility for innovation.

312
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:24.034
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I think that philosophy,
that IBM was able to do that, was

313
00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:24.335
<v Deb Goodkin>great.

314
00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:26.500
<v Deb Goodkin>I also learned a lot from my

315
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:32.669
<v Deb Goodkin>manager, who happened to be a
female, and her background was

316
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.432
<v Deb Goodkin>electrical engineering, too.

317
00:16:34.712 --> 00:16:37.036
<v Deb Goodkin>And she was such a good role model

318
00:16:37.316 --> 00:16:39.785
<v Deb Goodkin>for me, as well as a lot of the
other people there.

319
00:16:39.805 --> 00:16:42.894
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so it was a great experience
starting out.

320
00:16:45.145 --> 00:16:48.153
<v Karen Herman>Were there a lot of other women
that you were working with at the

321
00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:48.574
<v Karen Herman>time?
Did you?

322
00:16:49.781 --> 00:16:55.509
<v Deb Goodkin>So, there were real, I mean, I
would say it was 50-50.

323
00:16:55.689 --> 00:16:59.354
<v Deb Goodkin>But that group of people that they
hired, the group of college

324
00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:03.923
<v Deb Goodkin>students that they had hired when
I joined, I almost want to say it

325
00:17:03.963 --> 00:17:08.289
<v Deb Goodkin>was half and half of, of women and
men.

326
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:14.436
<v Deb Goodkin>And, which was really cool,
because it made it so, it made it

327
00:17:14.477 --> 00:17:15.099
<v Deb Goodkin>just normal.

328
00:17:15.661 --> 00:17:17.084
<v Deb Goodkin>And we were all, everyone was

329
00:17:17.164 --> 00:17:20.531
<v Deb Goodkin>really sharp, and came from
different backgrounds in different

330
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:20.951
<v Deb Goodkin>schools.

331
00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.236
<v Deb Goodkin>And, but we're all young, and we

332
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.221
<v Deb Goodkin>came from college.

333
00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:26.063
<v Deb Goodkin>And so we still wanted to enjoy

334
00:17:26.104 --> 00:17:26.564
<v Deb Goodkin>ourselves.

335
00:17:26.704 --> 00:17:30.770
<v Deb Goodkin>And so we actually formed great

336
00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:35.660
<v Deb Goodkin>relationships with each other,
too, where we would, you know,

337
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.164
<v Deb Goodkin>we'd go out on Friday nights
together, go dancing and, and

338
00:17:39.264 --> 00:17:39.484
<v Deb Goodkin>stuff.

339
00:17:39.504 --> 00:17:43.549
<v Deb Goodkin>So it was really, it was a great

340
00:17:43.609 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Deb Goodkin>friendship that we all had.

341
00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:50.900
<v Deb Goodkin>And then, and which, it didn't

342
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.745
<v Deb Goodkin>carry over to the other companies
I worked at.

343
00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so it was a really interesting
opportunity.

344
00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.920
<v Deb Goodkin>And in, you know, going forward, I
don't know if that's something

345
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:02.423
<v Deb Goodkin>that IBM continued to do.

346
00:18:02.463 --> 00:18:04.688
<v Deb Goodkin>But it was just happened to be the

347
00:18:04.748 --> 00:18:08.435
<v Deb Goodkin>timing when I joined that they
were just hiring a bunch of new

348
00:18:08.475 --> 00:18:08.795
<v Deb Goodkin>people.

349
00:18:10.987 --> 00:18:12.231
<v Karen Herman>Where did you go after IBM?

350
00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:14.543
<v Deb Goodkin>I went to Mac Store.

351
00:18:15.184 --> 00:18:16.266
<v Deb Goodkin>And so they're a disk drive

352
00:18:16.306 --> 00:18:18.590
<v Deb Goodkin>company, they were doing the five
and a quarter inch drives.

353
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I didn't do any firmware
for them, I actually joined as the

354
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:23.883
<v Deb Goodkin>applications engineer.

355
00:18:24.424 --> 00:18:25.787
<v Deb Goodkin>And so what that meant was that,

356
00:18:26.107 --> 00:18:29.033
<v Deb Goodkin>so you have the product, and it
could have been in development,

357
00:18:29.474 --> 00:18:30.760
<v Deb Goodkin>most time it was in development.

358
00:18:31.421 --> 00:18:33.384
<v Deb Goodkin>And but I worked with the

359
00:18:33.504 --> 00:18:36.308
<v Deb Goodkin>customers who wanted to use assist
drives.

360
00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:42.176
<v Deb Goodkin>And so most of the time, either I
would have those systems of those

361
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.846
<v Deb Goodkin>companies, or I would actually go
on site and, and basically make

362
00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:50.549
<v Deb Goodkin>sure that it worked in their
applications.

363
00:18:50.749 --> 00:18:59.042
<v Deb Goodkin>And then if it didn't, debugging
and, and figuring out or, you

364
00:18:59.062 --> 00:19:03.931
<v Deb Goodkin>know, working with the engineering
team, what, you know, is it on our

365
00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:05.514
<v Deb Goodkin>side?
Is it on the customer side?

366
00:19:05.554 --> 00:19:09.483
<v Deb Goodkin>Do they need to make changes?
And, and so it was really

367
00:19:09.503 --> 00:19:17.533
<v Deb Goodkin>interesting, because I got to work
with Sun Microsystems, DAC, HP,

368
00:19:17.834 --> 00:19:21.501
<v Deb Goodkin>NeXT computer, which isn't around
anymore, but that's like where

369
00:19:21.822 --> 00:19:24.046
<v Deb Goodkin>Wasnik went after Apple.

370
00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:26.250
<v Deb Goodkin>So that so working with NeXT was

371
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.915
<v Deb Goodkin>pretty exciting at that time,
because they're pretty cool.

372
00:19:31.544 --> 00:19:35.052
<v Karen Herman>And you were early in Silicon
Valley, that's really when things

373
00:19:35.072 --> 00:19:36.214
<v Karen Herman>are totally booming.

374
00:19:36.234 --> 00:19:36.775
<v Karen Herman>What was that like?

375
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.949
<v Deb Goodkin>It was just starting.

376
00:19:38.101 --> 00:19:40.024
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, it was just I mean, it's

377
00:19:40.064 --> 00:19:43.389
<v Deb Goodkin>funny, because I mean, tech, tech
was there.

378
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.840
<v Deb Goodkin>But it wasn't like the big boom,
which was happening, I think that

379
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.941
<v Deb Goodkin>was more in the 90s.

380
00:19:50.662 --> 00:19:53.166
<v Deb Goodkin>But yeah, you had, you had Apple,

381
00:19:53.446 --> 00:19:54.447
<v Deb Goodkin>and like I said, NeXT.

382
00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:56.350
<v Deb Goodkin>And so you had these really

383
00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:02.402
<v Deb Goodkin>innovative companies that were
just starting out and growing.

384
00:20:02.462 --> 00:20:05.848
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, HP had been around for a
while, DAC, same thing, but still

385
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:11.461
<v Deb Goodkin>working with some some of these,
you know, longtime companies like

386
00:20:11.481 --> 00:20:15.850
<v Deb Goodkin>DAC versus like, NeXT that came
out with this black computer.

387
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.593
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, no one had done that before.

388
00:20:17.613 --> 00:20:18.194
<v Deb Goodkin>It was really cool.

389
00:20:18.214 --> 00:20:19.461
<v Deb Goodkin>It was really innovative.

390
00:20:21.223 --> 00:20:22.746
<v Deb Goodkin>Sun was pretty well known.

391
00:20:23.567 --> 00:20:26.812
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so and so I got to work
with engineers at all those

392
00:20:26.852 --> 00:20:27.353
<v Deb Goodkin>companies.

393
00:20:27.673 --> 00:20:29.836
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so it was really good

394
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:36.189
<v Deb Goodkin>exposure, as well as learning,
learning opportunities, and seeing

395
00:20:36.249 --> 00:20:37.651
<v Deb Goodkin>how other companies worked.

396
00:20:38.813 --> 00:20:40.796
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and also just really problem

397
00:20:40.816 --> 00:20:44.070
<v Deb Goodkin>solving, trying to figure out why,
why something doesn't work.

398
00:20:45.803 --> 00:20:49.612
<v Karen Herman>Was there a lot of secrecy, and,
you know, kind of proprietary

399
00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:53.223
<v Karen Herman>knowledge and things like that?
So everything was proprietary,

400
00:20:53.323 --> 00:20:57.689
<v Deb Goodkin>but, um, but no, it wasn't like
that.

401
00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:02.376
<v Deb Goodkin>Like, so I think of secrecy, I
think of like Apple, how, how, I

402
00:21:02.416 --> 00:21:03.360
<v Deb Goodkin>mean, they're still like that.

403
00:21:05.843 --> 00:21:06.804
<v Deb Goodkin>Really successful.

404
00:21:07.324 --> 00:21:08.005
<v Deb Goodkin>That's how they work.

405
00:21:08.345 --> 00:21:11.929
<v Deb Goodkin>So I mean, I came here and think

406
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:17.496
<v Deb Goodkin>of whether, you know, did we have
NDAs?

407
00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:21.683
<v Deb Goodkin>Did I have to worry about that?
I actually don't remember that.

408
00:21:22.164 --> 00:21:25.850
<v Deb Goodkin>But all of our stuff, like, so all
the code that I wrote, that was

409
00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.132
<v Deb Goodkin>all proprietary code.

410
00:21:27.673 --> 00:21:32.703
<v Deb Goodkin>And, you know, and it's, I mean,

411
00:21:32.723 --> 00:21:38.650
<v Deb Goodkin>basically, it was up to us to
update that firm, and it was all

412
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:39.011
<v Deb Goodkin>firmware.

413
00:21:40.713 --> 00:21:42.215
<v Deb Goodkin>And so it resided on the drive.

414
00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:45.789
<v Deb Goodkin>And so it was up to us to update
that if there were any problems.

415
00:21:48.786 --> 00:21:50.790
<v Karen Herman>Or do you find that collaborative
as well?

416
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.438
<v Karen Herman>Or could you call people from
other companies or things like

417
00:21:54.478 --> 00:21:57.006
<v Karen Herman>that?
Well, it's definitely working with

418
00:21:57.026 --> 00:21:59.830
<v Deb Goodkin>the other companies was definitely
collaborative, because you wanted,

419
00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:01.432
<v Deb Goodkin>you wanted it to work.

420
00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:05.739
<v Deb Goodkin>So you didn't, so you had to work

421
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:06.182
<v Deb Goodkin>together.

422
00:22:06.202 --> 00:22:10.327
<v Deb Goodkin>And there was nothing competitive

423
00:22:10.787 --> 00:22:11.368
<v Deb Goodkin>about that.

424
00:22:12.329 --> 00:22:18.055
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so I remember it as just, you

425
00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:21.339
<v Deb Goodkin>know, friendly, friendly
environment, when, oh, and when I

426
00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:23.305
<v Deb Goodkin>would meet with when, oh, and when
I would meet with companies,

427
00:22:23.345 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Deb Goodkin>sometimes, especially like if it's
somewhere totally different, like

428
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.291
<v Deb Goodkin>I went to Maine.

429
00:22:28.353 --> 00:22:30.416
<v Deb Goodkin>And so the head engineering

430
00:22:30.676 --> 00:22:33.574
<v Deb Goodkin>manager there took me on this
little there took me on this

431
00:22:33.574 --> 00:22:37.691
<v Deb Goodkin>little sightseeing tour with his
wife, and which was, which was so

432
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:38.031
<v Deb Goodkin>nice.

433
00:22:38.612 --> 00:22:40.856
<v Deb Goodkin>And I, and I remember in Alabama,

434
00:22:40.876 --> 00:22:43.884
<v Deb Goodkin>going to the Space Center, when I
was there, and I can't remember

435
00:22:43.964 --> 00:22:44.845
<v Deb Goodkin>the company I was working with.

436
00:22:44.885 --> 00:22:49.151
<v Deb Goodkin>But, but yeah, that's, yeah, you

437
00:22:49.171 --> 00:22:52.836
<v Deb Goodkin>would have, over time, you'd build
relationships with people.

438
00:22:53.016 --> 00:22:56.484
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so that was always fun
when, when you had those

439
00:22:56.544 --> 00:22:57.686
<v Deb Goodkin>opportunities, too.

440
00:22:58.487 --> 00:23:00.370
<v Deb Goodkin>And then within the teams, I

441
00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.336
<v Deb Goodkin>always remember, whether it was at
IBM, or Maxstar, or any other, any

442
00:23:04.356 --> 00:23:08.547
<v Deb Goodkin>of the other jobs, I had that it
was always collaborative, you're

443
00:23:08.567 --> 00:23:13.415
<v Deb Goodkin>always working together with
other, other folks to create this

444
00:23:13.495 --> 00:23:15.819
<v Deb Goodkin>product or solve a problem.

445
00:23:15.819 --> 00:23:19.373
<v Karen Herman>And Maxstar, you started to be

446
00:23:19.493 --> 00:23:21.959
<v Karen Herman>more management, right?
You started to manage people as

447
00:23:21.999 --> 00:23:22.120
<v Karen Herman>well.

448
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.552
<v Deb Goodkin>So Maxstar was the first time,

449
00:23:23.592 --> 00:23:25.519
<v Deb Goodkin>yeah, I had a, I moved into a
management job.

450
00:23:25.539 --> 00:23:25.639
<v Deb Goodkin>Yes.

451
00:23:25.639 --> 00:23:27.395
<v Karen Herman>And where did you go from there?

452
00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:37.471
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so Maxstar actually bought
Miniscribe, which was based in

453
00:23:37.511 --> 00:23:37.992
<v Deb Goodkin>Colorado.

454
00:23:38.892 --> 00:23:41.595
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so I want, at the time, I

455
00:23:41.635 --> 00:23:44.498
<v Deb Goodkin>wanted to leave California for
various reasons.

456
00:23:44.518 --> 00:23:49.023
<v Deb Goodkin>And I was really interested in
moving to Colorado.

457
00:23:49.043 --> 00:23:54.747
<v Deb Goodkin>But at the time, they wouldn't
transfer any engineers to

458
00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:55.888
<v Deb Goodkin>Miniscribe.

459
00:23:57.189 --> 00:23:59.290
<v Deb Goodkin>And for various reasons.

460
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:03.833
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, since I had started
pursuing that, I thought, well,

461
00:24:04.193 --> 00:24:05.855
<v Deb Goodkin>okay, let me just look around.

462
00:24:05.975 --> 00:24:08.496
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I ended up working for a

463
00:24:08.556 --> 00:24:10.137
<v Deb Goodkin>company called Sirius Logic.

464
00:24:10.218 --> 00:24:11.378
<v Deb Goodkin>And so that was more, that was a

465
00:24:11.438 --> 00:24:11.999
<v Deb Goodkin>chip company.

466
00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:15.062
<v Deb Goodkin>So it was still in storage, but it

467
00:24:16.143 --> 00:24:17.243
<v Deb Goodkin>was at a different level.

468
00:24:17.844 --> 00:24:19.064
<v Deb Goodkin>Well, it was at a lower level.

469
00:24:19.445 --> 00:24:23.347
<v Deb Goodkin>And that I'd been working at
before and I stayed in

470
00:24:23.407 --> 00:24:26.589
<v Deb Goodkin>applications engineering, but it
was, we were referred to as field

471
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:27.890
<v Deb Goodkin>application engineers.

472
00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.651
<v Deb Goodkin>So you worked directly with a

473
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:36.175
<v Deb Goodkin>salesperson and you had customers
here in this region, and, and you

474
00:24:36.215 --> 00:24:37.256
<v Deb Goodkin>actually went on site.

475
00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:39.637
<v Deb Goodkin>And so typically, you would go to

476
00:24:39.657 --> 00:24:43.762
<v Deb Goodkin>either help them bring something
up, or if there was a problem, you

477
00:24:43.842 --> 00:24:45.323
<v Deb Goodkin>would go and help debug it.

478
00:24:46.525 --> 00:24:48.527
<v Deb Goodkin>And so it was sort of, it was more

479
00:24:48.567 --> 00:24:50.248
<v Deb Goodkin>like a technical sales role.

480
00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:51.529
<v Deb Goodkin>So it was, it was really

481
00:24:51.569 --> 00:24:52.951
<v Deb Goodkin>interesting to see that.

482
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:56.774
<v Deb Goodkin>You know, it's just sales is so

483
00:24:56.814 --> 00:24:59.217
<v Deb Goodkin>different than just engineering.

484
00:25:01.706 --> 00:25:02.770
<v Karen Herman>And it got you to Colorado.

485
00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.541
<v Deb Goodkin>It got me to Colorado.

486
00:25:04.601 --> 00:25:04.901
<v Deb Goodkin>Yep.

487
00:25:05.142 --> 00:25:07.123
<v Deb Goodkin>So it got me what I wanted.

488
00:25:07.163 --> 00:25:08.385
<v Deb Goodkin>It was a good, it was a good

489
00:25:08.425 --> 00:25:08.865
<v Deb Goodkin>company.

490
00:25:09.285 --> 00:25:10.687
<v Deb Goodkin>I have to say all the companies I

491
00:25:10.707 --> 00:25:11.167
<v Deb Goodkin>worked for.

492
00:25:11.187 --> 00:25:12.528
<v Deb Goodkin>They're great.

493
00:25:12.989 --> 00:25:15.691
<v Deb Goodkin>And yeah, great experiences.

494
00:25:17.193 --> 00:25:19.795
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, not I mean, it's not wasn't

495
00:25:19.835 --> 00:25:20.316
<v Deb Goodkin>perfect.

496
00:25:20.596 --> 00:25:22.418
<v Deb Goodkin>But, but yeah, they're good.

497
00:25:25.101 --> 00:25:27.623
<v Deb Goodkin>So there I didn't, I didn't last.

498
00:25:28.844 --> 00:25:30.245
<v Deb Goodkin>I maybe I worked for them for a

499
00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:30.425
<v Deb Goodkin>year.

500
00:25:30.465 --> 00:25:31.045
<v Deb Goodkin>I can't remember.

501
00:25:31.125 --> 00:25:32.566
<v Deb Goodkin>It wasn't, it wasn't long term.

502
00:25:33.647 --> 00:25:34.808
<v Deb Goodkin>I actually went from there and I

503
00:25:34.848 --> 00:25:39.111
<v Deb Goodkin>went to work for Connor
peripherals, which is was bought

504
00:25:39.191 --> 00:25:41.152
<v Deb Goodkin>by Seagate eventually after I
left.

505
00:25:41.633 --> 00:25:47.497
<v Deb Goodkin>And so Connor peripherals was
founded by these two guys.

506
00:25:48.097 --> 00:25:51.299
<v Deb Goodkin>And one of the guys actually was
based.

507
00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:53.722
<v Deb Goodkin>Well, actually, I think they both
were based out here.

508
00:25:54.363 --> 00:25:59.506
<v Deb Goodkin>But one still was in charge of
this facility and development

509
00:25:59.586 --> 00:25:59.906
<v Deb Goodkin>center.

510
00:26:00.287 --> 00:26:02.908
<v Deb Goodkin>And he was still a developer.

511
00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:07.011
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so I went back into
firmware.

512
00:26:07.571 --> 00:26:11.974
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so and I worked on SCSI
devices, just different computer

513
00:26:12.014 --> 00:26:12.455
<v Deb Goodkin>interface.

514
00:26:13.215 --> 00:26:16.357
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so I had the opportunity

515
00:26:16.377 --> 00:26:18.879
<v Deb Goodkin>to work with him, which was so
cool.

516
00:26:18.879 --> 00:26:19.000
<v Deb Goodkin>And, you so cool.

517
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.663
<v Deb Goodkin>And, you know, and back then, and

518
00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:27.926
<v Deb Goodkin>maybe this is also different than,
like working on a software project

519
00:26:28.486 --> 00:26:31.368
<v Deb Goodkin>is that you have a smaller code
set.

520
00:26:31.448 --> 00:26:34.810
<v Deb Goodkin>And so you don't need a large
group of people to work on it.

521
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:41.114
<v Deb Goodkin>So I basically own all the code
that from the computer interface

522
00:26:41.514 --> 00:26:47.697
<v Deb Goodkin>to the disk drive, to where you
send the, the data off to the

523
00:26:47.717 --> 00:26:49.178
<v Deb Goodkin>read, write logic.

524
00:26:49.178 --> 00:26:49.865
<v Deb Goodkin>And hardware.

525
00:26:53.405 --> 00:26:55.430
<v Karen Herman>How is that different from what
came before?

526
00:26:55.591 --> 00:26:59.750
<v Karen Herman>Was it was it completely?
Was it the only way to make that

527
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.662
<v Karen Herman>happen?
Yeah, you mean, in general, on a

528
00:27:03.962 --> 00:27:05.003
<v Deb Goodkin>distress?
Or?

529
00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:05.377
<v Karen Herman>Yeah.

530
00:27:05.543 --> 00:27:06.363
<v Deb Goodkin>It was just a larger.

531
00:27:06.664 --> 00:27:09.826
<v Deb Goodkin>Well, so like at IBM, you have a
lot more circuitry.

532
00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:17.611
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so when I wrote firmware
there, I was just writing, I wrote

533
00:27:17.651 --> 00:27:23.234
<v Deb Goodkin>the firmware that just basically
wrote the data to the E squared

534
00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:23.655
<v Deb Goodkin>prom.

535
00:27:23.815 --> 00:27:26.917
<v Deb Goodkin>And so it's a really small, small

536
00:27:26.977 --> 00:27:29.799
<v Deb Goodkin>component of this drive.

537
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.103
<v Deb Goodkin>Whereas at Connor, I was so you

538
00:27:34.143 --> 00:27:37.125
<v Deb Goodkin>have a disk drive, disk drive
talks to your computer.

539
00:27:37.345 --> 00:27:42.308
<v Deb Goodkin>So you have your operating system,
your host, and then it has you

540
00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:45.591
<v Deb Goodkin>have your file, you want to write
your file, you want to save it to

541
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:45.991
<v Deb Goodkin>the desk.

542
00:27:46.571 --> 00:27:50.754
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so your operating system would

543
00:27:50.774 --> 00:27:53.476
<v Deb Goodkin>send that file to the disk drive
disk drive.

544
00:27:53.496 --> 00:27:54.897
<v Deb Goodkin>So you have that interface.

545
00:27:55.057 --> 00:27:56.658
<v Deb Goodkin>And that's the part that I would

546
00:27:58.121 --> 00:27:58.501
<v Deb Goodkin>control.

547
00:27:59.161 --> 00:28:00.823
<v Deb Goodkin>And so and I would take the so you

548
00:28:00.863 --> 00:28:03.385
<v Deb Goodkin>communicate, you talk back and
forth, take the data.

549
00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:06.607
<v Deb Goodkin>So data is what you want to
protect.

550
00:28:06.627 --> 00:28:08.208
<v Deb Goodkin>So you don't want anything
corrupted.

551
00:28:08.969 --> 00:28:12.412
<v Deb Goodkin>And so and then you, you do
whatever you need to do with it in

552
00:28:12.432 --> 00:28:15.554
<v Deb Goodkin>the disk drive, and then the read
write code takes it and actually

553
00:28:15.594 --> 00:28:20.838
<v Deb Goodkin>writes it to, to the media, which
is a lot more complicated.

554
00:28:24.628 --> 00:28:26.266
<v Karen Herman>And you were at how long were you
at Connor?

555
00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:34.526
<v Deb Goodkin>I was at Connor for I can't
remember, five years, I'd have to,

556
00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:39.369
<v Deb Goodkin>I'd have to look back at, but you
know, it was basically so caught.

557
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:45.974
<v Deb Goodkin>So Connor was, um, I think it was
sort of the changing point in my

558
00:28:46.034 --> 00:28:55.002
<v Deb Goodkin>career where, um, you know, I
didn't quite like the nine to five

559
00:28:55.743 --> 00:29:06.110
<v Deb Goodkin>type of life and having to be in
meetings a lot and also judged on

560
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:10.033
<v Deb Goodkin>how many hours are you there
actually at the office.

561
00:29:10.053 --> 00:29:17.778
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so I knew people who
did what I did, but as consultants

562
00:29:17.858 --> 00:29:18.579
<v Deb Goodkin>or contractors.

563
00:29:18.579 --> 00:29:23.263
<v Deb Goodkin>And that's when I decided, I like

564
00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:25.264
<v Deb Goodkin>the idea of being more flexible.

565
00:29:25.905 --> 00:29:29.787
<v Deb Goodkin>And my skill was needed and

566
00:29:29.827 --> 00:29:30.247
<v Deb Goodkin>desired.

567
00:29:30.267 --> 00:29:31.228
<v Deb Goodkin>And there weren't a lot of people

568
00:29:31.268 --> 00:29:32.028
<v Deb Goodkin>who wrote firmware.

569
00:29:32.689 --> 00:29:34.390
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I took that chance of

570
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:39.153
<v Deb Goodkin>leaving and, and I had a contract
when I left and, and I just

571
00:29:39.193 --> 00:29:40.334
<v Deb Goodkin>contracted for years.

572
00:29:40.814 --> 00:29:43.075
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and it was great because I

573
00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:48.620
<v Deb Goodkin>felt like if people like the work
I was doing, they would hire me

574
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.541
<v Deb Goodkin>and they would pay me.

575
00:29:49.981 --> 00:29:51.122
<v Deb Goodkin>And I didn't have to spend a lot

576
00:29:51.162 --> 00:29:53.423
<v Deb Goodkin>of time, um, in meetings.

577
00:29:53.563 --> 00:29:55.205
<v Deb Goodkin>It didn't matter what my hours

578
00:29:55.265 --> 00:29:56.205
<v Deb Goodkin>were during the day.

579
00:29:56.225 --> 00:29:59.187
<v Deb Goodkin>And because one thing I really

580
00:29:59.247 --> 00:30:02.790
<v Deb Goodkin>like to do, and I still do this is
I like to start really early.

581
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:07.193
<v Deb Goodkin>And then I like to take one to two
hours off, um, before lunch to go

582
00:30:07.233 --> 00:30:07.733
<v Deb Goodkin>work out.

583
00:30:08.354 --> 00:30:09.955
<v Deb Goodkin>And I love having that

584
00:30:09.995 --> 00:30:10.775
<v Deb Goodkin>flexibility.

585
00:30:11.236 --> 00:30:14.478
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, so it was, it was

586
00:30:14.538 --> 00:30:14.738
<v Deb Goodkin>good.

587
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.323
<v Deb Goodkin>And I had, um, I contracted for

588
00:30:17.424 --> 00:30:24.375
<v Deb Goodkin>Sony and Seagate and, uh, Maxdor
and a lot of just different, uh,

589
00:30:24.415 --> 00:30:25.336
<v Deb Goodkin>disk drive companies.

590
00:30:27.664 --> 00:30:28.946
<v Karen Herman>And is that, and were you doing

591
00:30:28.986 --> 00:30:32.954
<v Karen Herman>that, um, when you, when you, um,
went to the FreeBSD foundation?

592
00:30:33.095 --> 00:30:37.142
<v Karen Herman>Was that?
So I, I, um, I wasn't quite doing

593
00:30:37.162 --> 00:30:38.943
<v Deb Goodkin>that much anymore.

594
00:30:39.043 --> 00:30:41.885
<v Deb Goodkin>What I, I have a gap really in my

595
00:30:42.005 --> 00:30:43.126
<v Deb Goodkin>engineering career.

596
00:30:43.246 --> 00:30:46.468
<v Deb Goodkin>Cause, uh, when 9/11 happened, um,

597
00:30:46.688 --> 00:30:51.971
<v Deb Goodkin>it changed, um, well really
affected the economy and, and

598
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:58.575
<v Deb Goodkin>companies and, uh, companies, when
they could hire, um, it would be

599
00:30:58.736 --> 00:31:02.178
<v Deb Goodkin>so hard for them to have a open a
rack that they wouldn't want it to

600
00:31:02.218 --> 00:31:02.878
<v Deb Goodkin>be full time.

601
00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.002
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and what I was always trying

602
00:31:05.022 --> 00:31:09.088
<v Deb Goodkin>to do was work part-time and maybe
I would take two contracts, two

603
00:31:09.128 --> 00:31:12.734
<v Deb Goodkin>part-time ones, or even just work
part-time and cause I had young

604
00:31:12.774 --> 00:31:14.796
<v Deb Goodkin>kids and that's what I wanted to
do at the time.

605
00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:19.894
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, so I found it really
difficult to find work.

606
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.013
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, so I, I took some time
off.

607
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.653
<v Deb Goodkin>I did, um, jumped in, in and out
of a few types of jobs.

608
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:33.671
<v Deb Goodkin>And then, um, and then I took on
the foundation and I did take it

609
00:31:33.711 --> 00:31:35.314
<v Deb Goodkin>on part-time at the beginning too.

610
00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.945
<v Deb Goodkin>And it was really because they

611
00:31:36.965 --> 00:31:39.072
<v Deb Goodkin>didn't have probably any money at
the time.

612
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.452
<v Deb Goodkin>So I saw it as an opportunity.

613
00:31:44.024 --> 00:31:44.304
<v Karen Herman>Okay.

614
00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:46.711
<v Karen Herman>Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's,
let's actually back up a little

615
00:31:46.732 --> 00:31:47.434
<v Karen Herman>bit and talk about that.

616
00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.107
<v Karen Herman>How did you first, um, you know,

617
00:31:51.488 --> 00:31:54.594
<v Karen Herman>hear about the FreeBSD foundation
and how did, how were you

618
00:31:54.674 --> 00:31:59.011
<v Karen Herman>connected?
So, um, the FreeBSD foundation, I

619
00:31:59.051 --> 00:31:59.974
<v Deb Goodkin>didn't know anything about.

620
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.527
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, so, uh, my friend had

621
00:32:04.587 --> 00:32:10.195
<v Deb Goodkin>contacted me and she said, so she
was working at this, um, aerospace

622
00:32:10.375 --> 00:32:11.437
<v Deb Goodkin>company here in Boulder.

623
00:32:11.437 --> 00:32:14.051
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, so I'm here in Boulder,

624
00:32:14.091 --> 00:32:14.533
<v Deb Goodkin>Colorado.

625
00:32:15.463 --> 00:32:18.032
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, and she said, I, there's a guy

626
00:32:18.112 --> 00:32:18.754
<v Deb Goodkin>at my company.

627
00:32:18.921 --> 00:32:20.728
<v Deb Goodkin>So she worked at an HR and she

628
00:32:20.768 --> 00:32:22.093
<v Deb Goodkin>said, there's this guy in my
company.

629
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:26.273
<v Deb Goodkin>He's running a nonprofit and he's
looking for someone to run it.

630
00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:31.613
<v Deb Goodkin>And I told him that I had a friend
who is an engineer and looking for

631
00:32:31.653 --> 00:32:32.014
<v Deb Goodkin>some work.

632
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.164
<v Deb Goodkin>And so anyway, so she connected us

633
00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:38.574
<v Deb Goodkin>and that was the first time I had
heard of FreeBSD and the FreeBSD

634
00:32:38.654 --> 00:32:39.175
<v Deb Goodkin>foundation.

635
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.665
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, so the guy she was

636
00:32:41.685 --> 00:32:45.614
<v Deb Goodkin>talking about was Justin Gibbs,
who's the founder of the FreeBSD

637
00:32:45.634 --> 00:32:46.115
<v Deb Goodkin>foundation.

638
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.546
<v Deb Goodkin>He's here in Boulder and he had

639
00:32:49.606 --> 00:32:52.513
<v Deb Goodkin>started the foundation, I think it
was about four or five years

640
00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:53.655
<v Deb Goodkin>before that.

641
00:32:54.362 --> 00:32:55.548
<v Deb Goodkin>And I bet he was working full

642
00:32:55.588 --> 00:32:55.870
<v Deb Goodkin>time.

643
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.388
<v Deb Goodkin>And so it was growing to the point

644
00:32:59.449 --> 00:33:01.614
<v Deb Goodkin>where he really couldn't run it.

645
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.725
<v Deb Goodkin>He, and he saw so much potential

646
00:33:03.845 --> 00:33:07.594
<v Deb Goodkin>for growth that he wanted to find
someone to run the company.

647
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.712
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so he went to my friend,
right.

648
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.552
<v Deb Goodkin>For just for advice on, you know,
how do I find someone?

649
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:20.132
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so we met at, had
lunch together and decided that I

650
00:33:20.833 --> 00:33:21.575
<v Deb Goodkin>was the right person.

651
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.365
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, so, so, you know, it, I,

652
00:33:26.786 --> 00:33:30.791
<v Deb Goodkin>I always feel like I lucked out in
the timing and the situation and,

653
00:33:31.432 --> 00:33:35.317
<v Deb Goodkin>um, and it's been, it's been a
great opportunity.

654
00:33:37.083 --> 00:33:41.073
<v Karen Herman>What did you know about the free
and open source world before you

655
00:33:41.113 --> 00:33:45.205
<v Karen Herman>started?
I knew nothing about it, which is

656
00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:49.051
<v Deb Goodkin>just so weird because I mean, when
I look at the history and stuff,

657
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:52.476
<v Deb Goodkin>cause I worked with Unix in the
early days.

658
00:33:53.621 --> 00:34:00.169
<v Deb Goodkin>So I knew about that, but, um, but
because I was so focused on disk

659
00:34:00.229 --> 00:34:04.755
<v Deb Goodkin>drives and storage and I worked,
um, on optical storage, it was

660
00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:06.197
<v Deb Goodkin>very focused what I did.

661
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.411
<v Deb Goodkin>And firmware is, um, it's almost

662
00:34:10.471 --> 00:34:11.313
<v Deb Goodkin>at the hardware level.

663
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.286
<v Deb Goodkin>So you don't even have the bigger

664
00:34:13.306 --> 00:34:14.371
<v Deb Goodkin>picture of software.

665
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.188
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so we, none of the

666
00:34:19.228 --> 00:34:22.114
<v Deb Goodkin>companies I worked at, we never
used open source.

667
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.553
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, so I didn't have any
exposure to it before that.

668
00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:31.106
<v Deb Goodkin>So, uh, so that was all new and,
and that's what made it so

669
00:34:31.146 --> 00:34:35.371
<v Deb Goodkin>interesting working for the
foundation because, um, I mean, I

670
00:34:35.411 --> 00:34:37.976
<v Deb Goodkin>had the engineering background,
but I didn't have operating system

671
00:34:37.996 --> 00:34:38.677
<v Deb Goodkin>background.

672
00:34:39.481 --> 00:34:42.891
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, open source didn't, that part

673
00:34:42.911 --> 00:34:43.693
<v Deb Goodkin>didn't really matter.

674
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.484
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, but I never worked for a

675
00:34:45.504 --> 00:34:48.413
<v Deb Goodkin>nonprofit, let alone run a
nonprofit.

676
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:54.409
<v Deb Goodkin>So, um, so I was stepping into
this whole new world and, um, and

677
00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.396
<v Deb Goodkin>so it was really a good learning
opportunity.

678
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.930
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, you talk about like every
day you have something, maybe not

679
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:04.184
<v Deb Goodkin>like fun, right?
Cause it, maybe you're figuring

680
00:35:04.244 --> 00:35:06.111
<v Deb Goodkin>out like, well, what can we
legally do?

681
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:11.253
<v Deb Goodkin>Or, you know, cause I needed to
hire myself and, uh, or employee

682
00:35:11.273 --> 00:35:11.614
<v Deb Goodkin>myself.

683
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.766
<v Deb Goodkin>I was the first employee.

684
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:16.044
<v Deb Goodkin>And so what does that mean?
What kind of, you know, what kind

685
00:35:16.084 --> 00:35:19.012
<v Deb Goodkin>of federal and state laws do you
have to follow to have an

686
00:35:19.072 --> 00:35:22.670
<v Deb Goodkin>employee?
And, uh, you know, so there's so

687
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:23.573
<v Deb Goodkin>many little things.

688
00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.403
<v Deb Goodkin>And unfortunately the friend that

689
00:35:26.443 --> 00:35:30.950
<v Deb Goodkin>I had at this one company that
Justin worked at, um, she actually

690
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:35.296
<v Deb Goodkin>gave me advice on, cause since she
was from HR, uh, she could

691
00:35:35.356 --> 00:35:38.391
<v Deb Goodkin>actually give me a little bit of
advice to, to get started.

692
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.830
<v Deb Goodkin>Like here, here's, here are the
government sites where you can get

693
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:42.953
<v Deb Goodkin>this type of information.

694
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.388
<v Deb Goodkin>So, uh, so I was always trying to

695
00:35:45.428 --> 00:35:46.272
<v Deb Goodkin>figure things out.

696
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.166
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and then, um, I, my focus

697
00:35:51.206 --> 00:35:55.291
<v Deb Goodkin>was really more on FreeBSD as an
operating system and trying to

698
00:35:55.311 --> 00:36:00.217
<v Deb Goodkin>understand that, understanding,
um, use cases and big companies.

699
00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.712
<v Deb Goodkin>Why are they using FreeBSD and how
are they using it?

700
00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.971
<v Deb Goodkin>And so understanding that over it
being open source.(something

701
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:20.092
<v Deb Goodkin>gibberish) Well, that's a really
good question.

702
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:27.029
<v Deb Goodkin>Uh, because he, so basically he
saw that, um, that he thought the

703
00:36:27.089 --> 00:36:31.836
<v Deb Goodkin>engineering side of me would
really help, uh, with project

704
00:36:31.876 --> 00:36:32.417
<v Deb Goodkin>management.

705
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.703
<v Deb Goodkin>And so at the time we were really

706
00:36:34.763 --> 00:36:38.849
<v Deb Goodkin>only funding projects and the
biggest project was, uh, making

707
00:36:38.949 --> 00:36:44.216
<v Deb Goodkin>sure the Java binaries from Sun,
um, worked on FreeBSD.

708
00:36:45.422 --> 00:36:49.533
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, so he thought I'd step in
and project manage that, which I

709
00:36:49.573 --> 00:36:49.754
<v Deb Goodkin>did.

710
00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.946
<v Deb Goodkin>That was my first project.

711
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.665
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, he also thought, I don't know
if I should make this on the

712
00:36:54.685 --> 00:37:00.594
<v Deb Goodkin>recording or not, but he, he also
thought as a mom that I'd be well

713
00:37:00.714 --> 00:37:02.036
<v Deb Goodkin>organized to run a company.

714
00:37:02.942 --> 00:37:04.307
<v Deb Goodkin>And I mean, little did he know, I

715
00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:06.052
<v Deb Goodkin>really wasn't very organized.

716
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:08.142
<v Deb Goodkin>So just cause you're a mom, I

717
00:37:09.003 --> 00:37:14.931
<v Deb Goodkin>mean, you're automatically an
organized person, but it's, but,

718
00:37:15.112 --> 00:37:18.957
<v Deb Goodkin>um, but maybe it helped me get a
job.

719
00:37:22.666 --> 00:37:24.873
<v Karen Herman>Did you, did you have, um, did you
have a lot of free reign when you

720
00:37:24.893 --> 00:37:26.063
<v Karen Herman>started?
I I mean, you basically had to

721
00:37:26.164 --> 00:37:28.111
<v Karen Herman>create the whole thing.

722
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:28.602
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah.

723
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.848
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, he really wanted me to
just, you know, please just, you

724
00:37:33.869 --> 00:37:37.215
<v Deb Goodkin>know, let me hand this off to you
and just go with it.

725
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.304
<v Deb Goodkin>But he was, he was always
available when I had questions

726
00:37:40.584 --> 00:37:48.295
<v Deb Goodkin>and, um, and so, so that's why, I
mean, it was a good opportunity

727
00:37:48.355 --> 00:37:49.457
<v Deb Goodkin>because I could do that.

728
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.145
<v Deb Goodkin>And so some of the stuff was just

729
00:37:52.606 --> 00:37:56.174
<v Deb Goodkin>administration, like, oh, let's
get a tax exempt, uh,

730
00:37:56.234 --> 00:37:56.895
<v Deb Goodkin>certification.

731
00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.663
<v Deb Goodkin>So we don't have to pay sales

732
00:37:58.723 --> 00:38:03.675
<v Deb Goodkin>taxes to just how to, you know,
which we do about taxes.

733
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:09.368
<v Deb Goodkin>And then, um, I, I did all of our
accounting and, um, and actually

734
00:38:09.409 --> 00:38:13.335
<v Deb Goodkin>that was one thing that I used to
do for my dad too was, um, was

735
00:38:13.695 --> 00:38:14.156
<v Deb Goodkin>accounting.

736
00:38:14.581 --> 00:38:16.771
<v Deb Goodkin>So I had that, that background.

737
00:38:17.421 --> 00:38:21.071
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, and so I did that for, for a
really long time for the company

738
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:22.013
<v Deb Goodkin>until we really grew.

739
00:38:23.242 --> 00:38:25.568
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, but yeah, he, he was

740
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.614
<v Deb Goodkin>available to ask questions.

741
00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.004
<v Deb Goodkin>We also had a board of directors

742
00:38:29.786 --> 00:38:32.133
<v Deb Goodkin>and they were at the time they
were hands on.

743
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:38.068
<v Deb Goodkin>So, um, so if you needed someone
to do like review, uh, a proposal

744
00:38:38.408 --> 00:38:42.374
<v Deb Goodkin>or actually to even write an
article for a newsletter, um, then

745
00:38:42.414 --> 00:38:44.417
<v Deb Goodkin>it was always a board member that
we do that.

746
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.265
<v Deb Goodkin>Cause it was just me.

747
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.470
<v Deb Goodkin>And then, um, and I was learning

748
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.032
<v Deb Goodkin>from them too.

749
00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.589
<v Deb Goodkin>What, um, you know, what was the

750
00:38:53.649 --> 00:38:56.615
<v Deb Goodkin>foundations, you know, what are
our long-term goals?

751
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:01.150
<v Deb Goodkin>What are we really trying to do?
And we're really defining that as

752
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:01.852
<v Deb Goodkin>time went by.

753
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.944
<v Deb Goodkin>Cause initially it was just to

754
00:39:03.984 --> 00:39:08.253
<v Deb Goodkin>fund certain projects and, um, oh,
provide travel grants to people to

755
00:39:08.293 --> 00:39:09.195
<v Deb Goodkin>go to conferences.

756
00:39:10.242 --> 00:39:12.206
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so then from there,

757
00:39:12.326 --> 00:39:16.015
<v Deb Goodkin>it's really, um, wasn't so much
like, what do we want to do?

758
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.747
<v Deb Goodkin>What does the project need?
Cause that's our purpose is to

759
00:39:19.767 --> 00:39:21.373
<v Deb Goodkin>support the project and the
community.

760
00:39:22.382 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, it's a lot of
discussions on that, which was,

761
00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.034
<v Deb Goodkin>um, which was always interesting.

762
00:39:27.884 --> 00:39:28.809
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, we still do that.

763
00:39:31.203 --> 00:39:35.228
<v Karen Herman>Talk about, so, so the, the
FreeBSD foundation and then

764
00:39:35.268 --> 00:39:40.696
<v Karen Herman>there's the FreeBSD, how, how does
that work, um, in terms of, you

765
00:39:40.736 --> 00:39:42.698
<v Karen Herman>know, how you work together or, or
don't?

766
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.597
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, we're two totally different
organizations.

767
00:39:47.597 --> 00:39:52.891
<v Deb Goodkin>And so the FreeBSD project is, uh,
made up of volunteers and, uh,

768
00:39:52.971 --> 00:39:56.817
<v Deb Goodkin>from around the world and it's not
a legal entity.

769
00:39:56.817 --> 00:40:02.895
<v Deb Goodkin>And we have the FreeBSD foundation
and, uh, which is a legal entity.

770
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:08.867
<v Deb Goodkin>It's, uh, um, here in the US we,
it's, um, based, uh, when the IRS,

771
00:40:09.328 --> 00:40:15.596
<v Deb Goodkin>um, uh, not certification, but,
um, a definition, um, is this that

772
00:40:15.616 --> 00:40:16.176
<v Deb Goodkin>we're a 501 C three.

773
00:40:17.502 --> 00:40:19.630
<v Deb Goodkin>And so there's different types of

774
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:20.573
<v Deb Goodkin>nonprofits here.

775
00:40:20.581 --> 00:40:22.992
<v Deb Goodkin>And so we're for the public good.

776
00:40:23.202 --> 00:40:25.892
<v Deb Goodkin>And so our whole purpose is to
support the project.

777
00:40:26.401 --> 00:40:31.471
<v Deb Goodkin>So if FreeBSD went away, then we
would most likely go away because

778
00:40:31.532 --> 00:40:33.275
<v Deb Goodkin>we wouldn't have a purpose
anymore.

779
00:40:33.961 --> 00:40:38.311
<v Deb Goodkin>And so there's a lot of
foundations out there that are

780
00:40:38.431 --> 00:40:40.215
<v Deb Goodkin>umbrella organizations.

781
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.743
<v Deb Goodkin>And so it means that they have the

782
00:40:41.784 --> 00:40:45.534
<v Deb Goodkin>foundation and then the project or
multiple projects are under them.

783
00:40:46.321 --> 00:40:49.626
<v Deb Goodkin>And so when you have it like that,
then you have a lot more control

784
00:40:49.646 --> 00:40:54.074
<v Deb Goodkin>of the project and I could tell,
basically, uh, direct them and

785
00:40:54.094 --> 00:40:55.336
<v Deb Goodkin>tell, tell them what to do.

786
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.927
<v Deb Goodkin>So the way that we work is that I

787
00:40:59.947 --> 00:41:03.433
<v Deb Goodkin>always, like, if I create an org
chart, I would put a side by side

788
00:41:04.214 --> 00:41:05.496
<v Deb Goodkin>and we could step in.

789
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.727
<v Deb Goodkin>And since we're a legal entity, we

790
00:41:08.747 --> 00:41:11.333
<v Deb Goodkin>could actually sign legal
documents on behalf of the

791
00:41:11.374 --> 00:41:11.775
<v Deb Goodkin>project.

792
00:41:12.741 --> 00:41:15.344
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, but also, uh, when we see

793
00:41:15.424 --> 00:41:19.970
<v Deb Goodkin>that there's needs or the project
comes to us with, with needs, um,

794
00:41:20.791 --> 00:41:24.396
<v Deb Goodkin>then we look at, we have funding
and, um, and so we might be able

795
00:41:24.676 --> 00:41:25.497
<v Deb Goodkin>to fund a project.

796
00:41:26.222 --> 00:41:29.270
<v Deb Goodkin>Or, um, or we buy equipment for

797
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.874
<v Deb Goodkin>the FreeBSD infrastructure.

798
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.487
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, uh, so basically, uh,

799
00:41:33.527 --> 00:41:35.994
<v Deb Goodkin>we'll provide resources for the
project.

800
00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:37.689
<v Deb Goodkin>We also do advocacy.

801
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, so we, uh, travel around

802
00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.474
<v Deb Goodkin>the world and give talks on
FreeBSD.

803
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.891
<v Deb Goodkin>We'll have, uh, tables at
conferences and we'll promote

804
00:41:46.931 --> 00:41:47.172
<v Deb Goodkin>FreeBSD.

805
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.686
<v Deb Goodkin>We provide literature and

806
00:41:49.826 --> 00:41:53.075
<v Deb Goodkin>educational material and, um, and
things like that.

807
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:58.185
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so we're always trying to
promote FreeBSD and, uh, we also

808
00:41:58.225 --> 00:42:03.670
<v Deb Goodkin>talk to, uh, companies that use
FreeBSD as well as potential users

809
00:42:04.111 --> 00:42:08.435
<v Deb Goodkin>and, uh, work on like value
propositions and why, why you

810
00:42:09.296 --> 00:42:10.417
<v Deb Goodkin>should use FreeBSD.

811
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.544
<v Deb Goodkin>So we're also, we also act as

812
00:42:13.925 --> 00:42:17.670
<v Deb Goodkin>salespeople for it, even though,
you know, I mean, cause FreeBSD is

813
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:21.196
<v Deb Goodkin>a product, it doesn't cost
anything to get it.

814
00:42:22.222 --> 00:42:25.353
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, but we want to get more people
using it.

815
00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:31.054
<v Karen Herman>So if someone doesn't know what
FreeBSD is, how would you describe

816
00:42:31.134 --> 00:42:32.285
<v Karen Herman>it?
And, you know, what's sort of your

817
00:42:32.305 --> 00:42:37.230
<v Karen Herman>sales pitch for it?
Um, well, usually, I mean, sadly

818
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:41.027
<v Deb Goodkin>we'll say, have you heard of Unix?
Cause I mean, not Unix, Linux, uh,

819
00:42:41.047 --> 00:42:42.192
<v Deb Goodkin>cause most people have heard of
Linux.

820
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:47.310
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so we'll say, you
know, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's,

821
00:42:47.611 --> 00:42:49.675
<v Deb Goodkin>it's, it's a free computer
operating system.

822
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:56.671
<v Deb Goodkin>It's based off of, uh, Unix, which
is over 50 years old and, uh, came

823
00:42:56.752 --> 00:42:59.176
<v Deb Goodkin>out of development out of, uh, out
of Berkeley.

824
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:05.112
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and it's used on, uh, you
know, you're, you're probably

825
00:43:05.192 --> 00:43:06.615
<v Deb Goodkin>using FreeBSD right now.

826
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.064
<v Deb Goodkin>Cause if you watch Netflix, all

827
00:43:09.104 --> 00:43:14.213
<v Deb Goodkin>those, um, shows and movies are
being streamed off FreeBSD

828
00:43:14.734 --> 00:43:15.416
<v Deb Goodkin>devices.

829
00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.822
<v Deb Goodkin>And if you're running, if you have

830
00:43:16.842 --> 00:43:22.731
<v Deb Goodkin>an iPhone, um, iOS and MacOS were
all originally developed off of,

831
00:43:22.972 --> 00:43:25.616
<v Deb Goodkin>um, BSD and then FreeBSD from
that.

832
00:43:25.759 --> 00:43:29.693
<v Deb Goodkin>And, oh, and the, the Sony
PlayStation is also FreeBSD based.

833
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.565
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so once, um, you use examples
of those types of companies that

834
00:43:34.585 --> 00:43:39.130
<v Deb Goodkin>are using FreeBSD, then people are
like, oh, and so, you know, so

835
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:45.581
<v Deb Goodkin>it's, it's a nice way to connect,
uh, FreeBSD to, uh, what they know

836
00:43:45.601 --> 00:43:46.707
<v Deb Goodkin>or what they're using today.

837
00:43:47.623 --> 00:43:49.210
<v Deb Goodkin>Cause even with Linux is the same

838
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.451
<v Deb Goodkin>thing.

839
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.484
<v Deb Goodkin>It's like, they've heard of it,

840
00:43:52.186 --> 00:43:55.414
<v Deb Goodkin>but are they running Linux on
their computers?

841
00:43:56.845 --> 00:43:58.090
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, most, most aren't.

842
00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.925
<v Deb Goodkin>So, I mean, we all know windows

843
00:44:00.487 --> 00:44:02.433
<v Deb Goodkin>and, um, and you know, MacOS.

844
00:44:04.864 --> 00:44:05.846
<v Karen Herman>And then, and then, and then in

845
00:44:05.886 --> 00:44:09.274
<v Karen Herman>terms of the, in terms of the open
source piece of it, um, talk about

846
00:44:09.314 --> 00:44:09.535
<v Karen Herman>that.

847
00:44:11.164 --> 00:44:14.794
<v Deb Goodkin>Well, so FreeBSD has a really long

848
00:44:14.854 --> 00:44:15.175
<v Deb Goodkin>history.

849
00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.545
<v Deb Goodkin>Like I was saying, it, um, it

850
00:44:18.585 --> 00:44:24.355
<v Deb Goodkin>branched off of the original Unix
and, um, and Unix became open

851
00:44:24.415 --> 00:44:25.737
<v Deb Goodkin>source eventually.

852
00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:31.808
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, it's like the real first

853
00:44:31.928 --> 00:44:34.852
<v Deb Goodkin>unencumbered Unix like operating
system actually came out of

854
00:44:34.872 --> 00:44:37.315
<v Deb Goodkin>Berkeley and it was called, uh,
386 BSD.

855
00:44:39.463 --> 00:44:43.153
<v Deb Goodkin>And that was back in the early
eighties.

856
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.234
<v Deb Goodkin>And so basically Berkeley took
Unix and developed on it.

857
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.189
<v Deb Goodkin>So some of it was for research.

858
00:44:50.982 --> 00:44:52.408
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, well, most of it was for

859
00:44:52.468 --> 00:44:52.870
<v Deb Goodkin>research.

860
00:44:53.481 --> 00:44:54.986
<v Deb Goodkin>They're being funded by the

861
00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:56.912
<v Deb Goodkin>government too, to work on it.

862
00:44:57.901 --> 00:45:02.768
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, you know, the first open

863
00:45:02.808 --> 00:45:07.616
<v Deb Goodkin>source really was, I think like in
the early fifties, cause when

864
00:45:07.636 --> 00:45:12.810
<v Deb Goodkin>these large companies like IBM and
Amdahl, when they, uh, so they

865
00:45:13.191 --> 00:45:14.995
<v Deb Goodkin>came, they developed these
computers.

866
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.728
<v Deb Goodkin>And so when they'd sell a
computer, that's where they made

867
00:45:18.768 --> 00:45:21.695
<v Deb Goodkin>their money, not on the operating
system or the software.

868
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:28.050
<v Deb Goodkin>So that they actually provided
that too, because also it was to

869
00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:31.496
<v Deb Goodkin>their benefit to have others make
it work for them.

870
00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.731
<v Deb Goodkin>And then it was more like when
windows came out, maybe it wasn't

871
00:45:35.751 --> 00:45:36.653
<v Deb Goodkin>windows cause it was DOS.

872
00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:38.924
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, then you started having,

873
00:45:39.324 --> 00:45:43.814
<v Deb Goodkin>seeing value in selling software
and then that's when it became

874
00:45:43.934 --> 00:45:44.755
<v Deb Goodkin>proprietary.

875
00:45:45.602 --> 00:45:48.772
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, so, so it had changed

876
00:45:48.832 --> 00:45:49.273
<v Deb Goodkin>over time.

877
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:49.522
<v Deb Goodkin>Right.

878
00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:54.746
<v Deb Goodkin>So when, um, so when like Berkeley
Unix and then Linux came out and

879
00:45:54.766 --> 00:46:00.193
<v Deb Goodkin>FreeBSD, um, that was, it was
considered, um, you know,

880
00:46:00.253 --> 00:46:02.717
<v Deb Goodkin>competitive to windows back then.

881
00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:05.457
<v Karen Herman>Okay.

882
00:46:05.815 --> 00:46:06.343
<v Karen Herman>And talk to me...

883
00:46:06.343 --> 00:46:09.588
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so I get, so getting back to

884
00:46:09.628 --> 00:46:14.716
<v Deb Goodkin>like open source, the FreeBSD, um,
I mean, we, so we were really one

885
00:46:14.736 --> 00:46:16.899
<v Deb Goodkin>of the first open source projects
around.

886
00:46:16.899 --> 00:46:17.019
<v Deb Goodkin>We weren't the first, but we were
one first open source projects

887
00:46:17.019 --> 00:46:17.029
<v Deb Goodkin>around.

888
00:46:17.029 --> 00:46:17.099
<v Deb Goodkin>We weren't the first, but we were

889
00:46:17.099 --> 00:46:20.089
<v Deb Goodkin>one of the first, um, and largest
and most successful really.

890
00:46:24.825 --> 00:46:28.440
<v Deb Goodkin>And we're still around and we're
still growing.

891
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:28.470
<v Deb Goodkin>So still growing.

892
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.671
<v Deb Goodkin>So it's not like we're still just,

893
00:46:31.313 --> 00:46:33.839
<v Deb Goodkin>you know, I mean, we're still,
we're still growing.

894
00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:33.929
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, we're getting more still,
we're still growing.

895
00:46:33.929 --> 00:46:38.372
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, we're getting more users
and, um, you know, more companies

896
00:46:39.174 --> 00:46:40.055
<v Deb Goodkin>using FreeBSD.

897
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.662
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so we have a very long history

898
00:46:43.083 --> 00:46:47.608
<v Deb Goodkin>and, um, and also, and a lot of
open source projects can learn

899
00:46:47.688 --> 00:46:51.613
<v Deb Goodkin>from, you know, our government
governance model, as well as some

900
00:46:51.633 --> 00:46:54.336
<v Deb Goodkin>of the things that we did in the
early days to, to make it

901
00:46:54.396 --> 00:46:54.917
<v Deb Goodkin>successful.

902
00:46:56.787 --> 00:46:57.711
<v Karen Herman>Can you talk about that?

903
00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.609
<v Karen Herman>What those things that you did in
the early days?

904
00:47:01.161 --> 00:47:05.285
<v Deb Goodkin>So, um, some of them were in, and
I wasn't around for these, but,

905
00:47:06.026 --> 00:47:12.573
<v Deb Goodkin>um, um, like they use a software,
uh, source control, um, version

906
00:47:12.593 --> 00:47:16.317
<v Deb Goodkin>control, um, back in the early
days where when other projects

907
00:47:16.357 --> 00:47:16.577
<v Deb Goodkin>done.

908
00:47:17.061 --> 00:47:20.511
<v Deb Goodkin>Now I did, but he's, I did, that's

909
00:47:20.792 --> 00:47:21.574
<v Deb Goodkin>something that we did.

910
00:47:22.322 --> 00:47:23.467
<v Deb Goodkin>But apparently open source

911
00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:24.872
<v Deb Goodkin>projects did not.

912
00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.405
<v Deb Goodkin>And so it's something we still do

913
00:47:26.445 --> 00:47:28.192
<v Deb Goodkin>on most projects.

914
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.448
<v Deb Goodkin>All, all, all of them, most of

915
00:47:30.468 --> 00:47:31.532
<v Deb Goodkin>them will use Git now.

916
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.283
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, so that was one thing, a flat,

917
00:47:36.324 --> 00:47:45.453
<v Deb Goodkin>um, um, a flat development model,
meaning that, um, we, if you

918
00:47:45.473 --> 00:47:50.277
<v Deb Goodkin>compare, uh, so a lot of, uh,
comparisons happen between FreeBSD

919
00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:50.657
<v Deb Goodkin>and Linux.

920
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:54.705
<v Deb Goodkin>And Linux, you have, um, Linus

921
00:47:54.745 --> 00:47:59.892
<v Deb Goodkin>Torvalds, who is the one who came
up with Linux and is still the

922
00:47:59.932 --> 00:48:03.517
<v Deb Goodkin>head person there, and you have a
lieutenant structure.

923
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.770
<v Deb Goodkin>And so when you make a change, it
has to go up that hierarchy to get

924
00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:11.055
<v Deb Goodkin>approved and, or reviewed.

925
00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:13.650
<v Deb Goodkin>And within FreeBSD, it's a flat

926
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.071
<v Deb Goodkin>structure.

927
00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:17.266
<v Deb Goodkin>And so you can submit something

928
00:48:17.326 --> 00:48:21.655
<v Deb Goodkin>and someone within the team will
review and either approve it or

929
00:48:21.695 --> 00:48:21.935
<v Deb Goodkin>not.

930
00:48:22.861 --> 00:48:24.104
<v Deb Goodkin>Uh, it doesn't mean it has low

931
00:48:24.124 --> 00:48:27.130
<v Deb Goodkin>standards, but it, it does mean
it's much easier to get your

932
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:30.196
<v Deb Goodkin>changes in because of time.

933
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.004
<v Deb Goodkin>You don't have so many people that

934
00:48:33.044 --> 00:48:37.571
<v Deb Goodkin>it has to go through, or even
just, even if it was just like a

935
00:48:37.651 --> 00:48:40.375
<v Deb Goodkin>couple of people, it's just people
have to be available to, to

936
00:48:40.676 --> 00:48:41.056
<v Deb Goodkin>review.

937
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.864
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, so we find like,

938
00:48:44.924 --> 00:48:49.268
<v Deb Goodkin>especially like with companies,
um, that they like that because it

939
00:48:49.368 --> 00:48:53.053
<v Deb Goodkin>is easier for them to get their
changes in, um, as well as, uh,

940
00:48:53.213 --> 00:48:57.397
<v Deb Goodkin>just contributors that, um, that
they don't have to wait so long.

941
00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:01.852
<v Deb Goodkin>And especially if you're new too,
that, um, you can get changes in

942
00:49:01.892 --> 00:49:02.393
<v Deb Goodkin>much quicker.

943
00:49:03.742 --> 00:49:05.246
<v Deb Goodkin>So that, so that's a, that's a big

944
00:49:05.847 --> 00:49:08.974
<v Deb Goodkin>thing that started from, um, the
early days.

945
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:14.414
<v Deb Goodkin>Basically, the governance model
was developed at Berkeley.

946
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:20.187
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so they had, if I
remember correctly, they had their

947
00:49:20.267 --> 00:49:23.491
<v Deb Goodkin>small team of people who did
commit the code, but they had a

948
00:49:23.532 --> 00:49:27.016
<v Deb Goodkin>lot of other contributors outside
and they would submit their

949
00:49:27.056 --> 00:49:27.437
<v Deb Goodkin>changes.

950
00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.743
<v Deb Goodkin>And then you'd have the Berkeley

951
00:49:28.783 --> 00:49:32.974
<v Deb Goodkin>folks, um, who would actually
commit the code to the, the source

952
00:49:33.014 --> 00:49:33.194
<v Deb Goodkin>tree.

953
00:49:35.368 --> 00:49:36.774
<v Karen Herman>Got it.

954
00:49:36.774 --> 00:49:41.593
<v Karen Herman>Um, talk about, about some of the
main projects that, um, this

955
00:49:41.633 --> 00:49:42.455
<v Karen Herman>foundation has funded.

956
00:49:44.663 --> 00:49:47.068
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, so like I mentioned, so early

957
00:49:47.108 --> 00:49:50.995
<v Deb Goodkin>on Java binaries, um, that was big
having that support in there.

958
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.389
<v Deb Goodkin>And then, um, and Java binaries
moved on to being, uh, open

959
00:49:55.429 --> 00:49:57.654
<v Deb Goodkin>source, the Java code, Java.

960
00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.568
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, and so we haven't had to step

961
00:50:00.668 --> 00:50:01.893
<v Deb Goodkin>in for that much.

962
00:50:02.161 --> 00:50:04.131
<v Deb Goodkin>We do a little support there.

963
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:10.589
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, so, um, some of the projects
that we've funded, well, if you

964
00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:13.793
<v Deb Goodkin>look outside of development, so
we're always focused on like what

965
00:50:13.833 --> 00:50:16.116
<v Deb Goodkin>software development projects have
we supported.

966
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:23.933
<v Deb Goodkin>And we have, um, also stepped in
and put a lot of resources into

967
00:50:24.134 --> 00:50:25.256
<v Deb Goodkin>this whole advocacy.

968
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:29.403
<v Deb Goodkin>So, um, from just providing

969
00:50:29.543 --> 00:50:37.369
<v Deb Goodkin>literature, handouts, um, how to
guides, um, putting together

970
00:50:37.489 --> 00:50:42.112
<v Deb Goodkin>online content, getting speakers
to talk about various parts of

971
00:50:42.132 --> 00:50:48.357
<v Deb Goodkin>FreeBSD, um, that's, I mean, those
are multiple projects, but all

972
00:50:48.497 --> 00:50:49.838
<v Deb Goodkin>falls under advocacy.

973
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:50.962
<v Deb Goodkin>And that's one of the biggest

974
00:50:51.023 --> 00:50:54.794
<v Deb Goodkin>things that we've grown over the
past few years.

975
00:50:56.381 --> 00:51:03.528
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, we, my head's like, sort of
this blank right now on like what,

976
00:51:03.608 --> 00:51:08.253
<v Deb Goodkin>like software projects, but we do
have one, one big project that we

977
00:51:08.293 --> 00:51:12.137
<v Deb Goodkin>did fund was, uh, what's called
the Linux, Linuxulator.

978
00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:17.847
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and basically what allows
you to do is on FreeBSD, you can

979
00:51:18.307 --> 00:51:23.935
<v Deb Goodkin>run Linux binaries that, um, so,
and those will run on FreeBSD.

980
00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:30.250
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, other things coming out of the
project, just the open ZFS or ZFS

981
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:32.915
<v Deb Goodkin>support, and we have funded
projects there.

982
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.266
<v Deb Goodkin>That's been big.

983
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.064
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, Jails was really the first

984
00:51:38.465 --> 00:51:42.531
<v Deb Goodkin>containers that you hear about
Docker, but Jails were the first

985
00:51:42.571 --> 00:51:46.636
<v Deb Goodkin>containers that, um, that was
developed on FreeBSD.

986
00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.966
<v Deb Goodkin>That wasn't something that we did,
but really, um, you know, one of

987
00:51:51.006 --> 00:51:57.615
<v Deb Goodkin>the significant, um, you know,
features, um, way back when, early

988
00:51:57.635 --> 00:51:57.655
<v Deb Goodkin>2000s.

989
00:52:02.405 --> 00:52:05.071
<v Karen Herman>How, um, how are, uh, how do

990
00:52:05.111 --> 00:52:06.855
<v Karen Herman>people, uh, get their projects
funded?

991
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.824
<v Karen Herman>What's the process?
So there's a couple things, ways,

992
00:52:10.844 --> 00:52:16.273
<v Deb Goodkin>uh, we do have a, a CFP or we
have, uh, actually it's a project

993
00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:18.176
<v Deb Goodkin>proposal application.

994
00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.607
<v Deb Goodkin>And so we have information on our

995
00:52:21.647 --> 00:52:25.235
<v Deb Goodkin>website on how to submit a
proposal.

996
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:30.050
<v Deb Goodkin>So say you have an interest in
implementing something and, um,

997
00:52:31.233 --> 00:52:32.175
<v Deb Goodkin>but you need funding.

998
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.806
<v Deb Goodkin>So usually the case is this

999
00:52:34.886 --> 00:52:38.194
<v Deb Goodkin>person, maybe they have to take
time off of work to do this.

1000
00:52:38.821 --> 00:52:42.110
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, so they actually, so they
write up the proposal, like what

1001
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:46.029
<v Deb Goodkin>is it that they want to do?
What are the outcomes and what's

1002
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:48.428
<v Deb Goodkin>the timeframe?
And then what's the cost?

1003
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:49.808
<v Deb Goodkin>And then they submit that to us.

1004
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.183
<v Deb Goodkin>And then what we do is, uh, we

1005
00:52:52.244 --> 00:52:56.330
<v Deb Goodkin>review it internally and then
sometimes we'll actually, uh, send

1006
00:52:56.411 --> 00:53:00.984
<v Deb Goodkin>it to developers to get their
input on, um, is this a project

1007
00:53:01.366 --> 00:53:04.203
<v Deb Goodkin>that would help FreeBSD?
Because we're always looking at

1008
00:53:05.064 --> 00:53:09.975
<v Deb Goodkin>funding projects that really help
further FreeBSD in various ways.

1009
00:53:10.441 --> 00:53:13.589
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, you know, it could be
fixing a problem or it could be

1010
00:53:13.649 --> 00:53:17.626
<v Deb Goodkin>implementing a new feature and
really just keeping it, uh,

1011
00:53:17.747 --> 00:53:20.374
<v Deb Goodkin>secure, stable, and, and
innovative.

1012
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.970
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so that's one way that we do
it.

1013
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.928
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, and then the other is that by
working with companies and

1014
00:53:27.969 --> 00:53:32.582
<v Deb Goodkin>understanding, uh, their uses and
their needs, as well as

1015
00:53:33.184 --> 00:53:36.233
<v Deb Goodkin>understanding market trends and
just what's happening out there,

1016
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.170
<v Deb Goodkin>then we also have internal
roadmap.

1017
00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:43.453
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so we look at how do
we fund that work?

1018
00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:48.329
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, and we have software
developers on our own staff and,

1019
00:53:48.569 --> 00:53:51.776
<v Deb Goodkin>um, and so we fund them to work in
various areas.

1020
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.391
<v Deb Goodkin>And we may hire someone to do
specific work or we may just

1021
00:53:55.411 --> 00:53:56.354
<v Deb Goodkin>contract people too.

1022
00:53:59.485 --> 00:54:01.751
<v Karen Herman>Do, um, the companies, the

1023
00:54:01.811 --> 00:54:04.203
<v Karen Herman>companies that you're doing some
of that work with, do they also

1024
00:54:04.303 --> 00:54:09.246
<v Karen Herman>fund the projects as well for you?
Most, most of the funding is, so

1025
00:54:09.266 --> 00:54:11.173
<v Deb Goodkin>most of our funding does come from
companies.

1026
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:17.832
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so it's, um, it's
almost a hundred percent, uh,

1027
00:54:17.913 --> 00:54:19.255
<v Deb Goodkin>towards our general funds.

1028
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:21.226
<v Deb Goodkin>So rarely do we take earmark

1029
00:54:21.266 --> 00:54:22.471
<v Deb Goodkin>funding, but we do do that.

1030
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.525
<v Deb Goodkin>So if we have a project, so if a

1031
00:54:24.565 --> 00:54:28.823
<v Deb Goodkin>company wants something and we
feel it's beneficial to FreeBSD in

1032
00:54:28.863 --> 00:54:33.034
<v Deb Goodkin>general, then, uh, if we have the
resources, we'll do that work.

1033
00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:37.550
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, but most of the time
companies will give to us because

1034
00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:41.346
<v Deb Goodkin>they know that, uh, the money that
they're giving to us is helping,

1035
00:54:41.366 --> 00:54:43.894
<v Deb Goodkin>um, in these areas I talked about.

1036
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.806
<v Deb Goodkin>So we have people on the security

1037
00:54:45.846 --> 00:54:47.251
<v Deb Goodkin>team, so it's helping with that.

1038
00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.265
<v Deb Goodkin>Uh, we have people on staff who

1039
00:54:49.285 --> 00:54:52.802
<v Deb Goodkin>will just step in and fix bugs
right away, uh, whether they're

1040
00:54:52.962 --> 00:54:58.020
<v Deb Goodkin>our bugs or hardware bugs and, uh,
just really having that, the

1041
00:54:58.081 --> 00:55:00.952
<v Deb Goodkin>resources available to get on top
of things quickly.

1042
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.672
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, so knowing that the
money is going towards that, I

1043
00:55:05.872 --> 00:55:09.790
<v Deb Goodkin>mean, we, we try to be as
transparent as possible with where

1044
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:10.613
<v Deb Goodkin>our money is going.

1045
00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.307
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, we post more high level,

1046
00:55:13.608 --> 00:55:16.782
<v Deb Goodkin>um, state, you know, financial
statements on our website, but we

1047
00:55:17.123 --> 00:55:20.614
<v Deb Goodkin>do try to be, um, open about how
we're spending our money.

1048
00:55:21.442 --> 00:55:25.174
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so anyway, that's, that's
why that they'll give us money.

1049
00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:29.370
<v Deb Goodkin>We also get money from other
companies that they might not use

1050
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:33.986
<v Deb Goodkin>FreeBSD, but you know, or they
know that they're benefiting by

1051
00:55:34.066 --> 00:55:37.734
<v Deb Goodkin>supporting us because it helps the
open source ecosystem.

1052
00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.469
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and also there's
components within FreeBSD that are

1053
00:55:42.649 --> 00:55:49.308
<v Deb Goodkin>used, um, by other companies in
their products or just, um, just

1054
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:53.506
<v Deb Goodkin>used in however way that they're
using software operating systems.

1055
00:55:55.083 --> 00:55:58.952
<v Karen Herman>Are most companies pretty open
about, you know, saying that they

1056
00:55:59.032 --> 00:56:04.450
<v Karen Herman>use FreeBSD?
Um, some are, and I, no one is

1057
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.515
<v Deb Goodkin>trying to be secretive about using
it.

1058
00:56:06.515 --> 00:56:09.952
<v Deb Goodkin>It's It's just that that's not
what's important to their product.

1059
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:15.511
<v Deb Goodkin>So you wouldn't see, you wouldn't
see Sony selling their

1060
00:56:15.551 --> 00:56:20.909
<v Deb Goodkin>PlayStation, you know, saying, oh,
it runs on FreeBSD because it's

1061
00:56:20.949 --> 00:56:23.134
<v Deb Goodkin>the PlayStation that they're
selling.

1062
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:28.792
<v Deb Goodkin>That's, that's, what's important
using FreeBSD is getting them what

1063
00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:33.049
<v Deb Goodkin>they need in order to create that,
you know, that fabulous product

1064
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:34.653
<v Deb Goodkin>that everyone wants.

1065
00:56:35.041 --> 00:56:36.245
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, then there's the other

1066
00:56:36.285 --> 00:56:38.132
<v Deb Goodkin>companies like Netflix is really
good.

1067
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.810
<v Deb Goodkin>They're a big advocate of FreeBSD
and they, they've actually given

1068
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:46.511
<v Deb Goodkin>talks about the high transfer
rates that they achieve on the

1069
00:56:46.571 --> 00:56:47.032
<v Deb Goodkin>internet.

1070
00:56:47.401 --> 00:56:49.210
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, which is great.

1071
00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:54.271
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, cause it helps FreeBSD,
uh, we love to see it and we

1072
00:56:54.351 --> 00:56:57.784
<v Deb Goodkin>really appreciate it when, uh,
when companies are really open

1073
00:56:58.386 --> 00:57:02.506
<v Deb Goodkin>about that and, um, and actually
give talks or write articles about

1074
00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:02.586
<v Deb Goodkin>it.

1075
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:07.196
<v Karen Herman>Talk a bit about just the open

1076
00:57:07.236 --> 00:57:08.320
<v Karen Herman>source community in general.

1077
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.889
<v Karen Herman>Um, do you, do you notice any

1078
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:13.519
<v Karen Herman>trends or, or personality features
about people that are in that

1079
00:57:13.519 --> 00:57:18.831
<v Karen Herman>community?
Um, I mean, I think you could say

1080
00:57:18.871 --> 00:57:23.907
<v Deb Goodkin>that in just tech in general, um,
you know, and, and so I've been

1081
00:57:23.927 --> 00:57:28.439
<v Deb Goodkin>around a lot of different types of
technical, technical people.

1082
00:57:28.569 --> 00:57:30.709
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, open source is, is interesting
cause people are doing open

1083
00:57:30.769 --> 00:57:31.170
<v Deb Goodkin>source.

1084
00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.547
<v Deb Goodkin>Most of them are doing those

1085
00:57:35.587 --> 00:57:37.494
<v Deb Goodkin>because they're passionate about
it.

1086
00:57:37.494 --> 00:57:38.848
<v Deb Goodkin>So they're not getting paid to
work on it.

1087
00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.008
<v Deb Goodkin>So, um, so like any type of
organization that uses volunteers,

1088
00:57:43.749 --> 00:57:47.022
<v Deb Goodkin>whether it's, you know, like the
humane society, if you love

1089
00:57:47.043 --> 00:57:52.388
<v Deb Goodkin>animals, um, they're there because
they're passionate about it.

1090
00:57:52.514 --> 00:57:52.846
<v Deb Goodkin>And so you see that.

1091
00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:53.944
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, and that's exciting.

1092
00:57:55.220 --> 00:58:00.010
<v Deb Goodkin>And to see people giving their
time, their free time, which is

1093
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:01.473
<v Deb Goodkin>pretty valuable.

1094
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.066
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, it, it speaks a lot to it.

1095
00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:09.033
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, uh, I do see that a lot in
our community.

1096
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:12.308
<v Deb Goodkin>I see us as a pretty diverse, uh,
but friendly community.

1097
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:25.924
<v Deb Goodkin>And when I say diverse, I really
mean in, um, like culture and

1098
00:58:26.405 --> 00:58:32.175
<v Deb Goodkin>backgrounds of people, um,
experiences and cause you'll have

1099
00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:35.909
<v Deb Goodkin>people who they want to get
involved in open source and they

1100
00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:37.694
<v Deb Goodkin>feel like, well, I'm not
qualified.

1101
00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:41.211
<v Deb Goodkin>I'm not technical or I don't write
code, but they want to be

1102
00:58:41.271 --> 00:58:41.793
<v Deb Goodkin>involved.

1103
00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.249
<v Deb Goodkin>And they think that they're lesser

1104
00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:45.192
<v Deb Goodkin>because of that.

1105
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.785
<v Deb Goodkin>And I know in our project, um,

1106
00:58:48.707 --> 00:58:52.701
<v Deb Goodkin>like documentation is viewed so
highly that if you come in and you

1107
00:58:52.721 --> 00:58:55.752
<v Deb Goodkin>write documentation, you're viewed
highly.

1108
00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:59.232
<v Deb Goodkin>You're not any lesser because
you're not writing code.

1109
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:03.150
<v Deb Goodkin>And we have people who create
videos on previous D cause they

1110
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:07.349
<v Deb Goodkin>love it, but they, they can't
write code or, you know, that's

1111
00:59:07.369 --> 00:59:07.991
<v Deb Goodkin>not their strength.

1112
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:10.685
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and I love seeing these

1113
00:59:11.086 --> 00:59:14.635
<v Deb Goodkin>and, I mean, we could share these
videos that they create.

1114
00:59:15.602 --> 00:59:19.011
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so there's, there's
just so many different ways that

1115
00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:20.174
<v Deb Goodkin>you contribute.

1116
00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.424
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and that's in general open

1117
00:59:22.464 --> 00:59:29.204
<v Deb Goodkin>source, but, um, but I do see this
in previous D a lot more as far as

1118
00:59:30.749 --> 00:59:31.873
<v Deb Goodkin>being more equal.

1119
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:36.288
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, but also having, um, some

1120
00:59:36.328 --> 00:59:40.344
<v Deb Goodkin>of these original, um, Berkeley
people still in our community.

1121
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:44.711
<v Deb Goodkin>And when you go to our conferences
that they're available to talk to,

1122
00:59:44.832 --> 00:59:49.849
<v Deb Goodkin>and they love telling stories and
they help, um, bring up these new,

1123
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.704
<v Deb Goodkin>like, you know, younger, usually
it's like it's like younger

1124
00:59:52.744 --> 00:59:53.066
<v Deb Goodkin>people.

1125
00:59:53.066 --> 00:59:55.649
<v Deb Goodkin>Uh, Uh, and, uh, and that's always

1126
00:59:55.709 --> 00:59:56.733
<v Deb Goodkin>exciting to see.

1127
00:59:57.522 --> 00:59:58.626
<v Deb Goodkin>And then when we do have these

1128
00:59:58.666 --> 01:00:01.073
<v Deb Goodkin>conferences, there's so much that
happens there.

1129
01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:06.272
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, and I, the biggest thing
is you always have presentations,

1130
01:00:06.492 --> 01:00:07.815
<v Deb Goodkin>which are great.

1131
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.263
<v Deb Goodkin>And that's usually why you go, but

1132
01:00:09.303 --> 01:00:14.962
<v Deb Goodkin>you have hallway tracks and, or
social events and you have, oh,

1133
01:00:14.982 --> 01:00:16.649
<v Deb Goodkin>and we'll always have a hacker
lounge too.

1134
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.571
<v Deb Goodkin>And so you have this opportunity
to work together and come up with

1135
01:00:21.631 --> 01:00:25.450
<v Deb Goodkin>new ideas, or maybe someone has an
idea and now they're sharing that

1136
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.791
<v Deb Goodkin>idea.

1137
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.165
<v Deb Goodkin>And now you have other people who

1138
01:00:27.205 --> 01:00:28.852
<v Deb Goodkin>are interested in working on this.

1139
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.104
<v Deb Goodkin>And so everyone always leaves

1140
01:00:31.505 --> 01:00:35.634
<v Deb Goodkin>these conferences pretty much
exhausted, but really excited.

1141
01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.370
<v Deb Goodkin>So, uh, so those are extremely
important.

1142
01:00:40.346 --> 01:00:42.433
<v Karen Herman>Talk about the international
aspect of it as well.

1143
01:00:43.983 --> 01:00:49.976
<v Deb Goodkin>The, yeah, it's, I mean, it's,
it's a US focus because like the

1144
01:00:50.016 --> 01:00:54.431
<v Deb Goodkin>foundation, we're a US
corporation, but, and I don't

1145
01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:57.555
<v Deb Goodkin>know, I can't remember what the
breakout is of number of like US

1146
01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:03.476
<v Deb Goodkin>contributors to outside the US,
but you have people from all over

1147
01:01:03.497 --> 01:01:07.729
<v Deb Goodkin>the world and, and, um, you know,
we have lots of people in Europe

1148
01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:16.031
<v Deb Goodkin>and, uh, people in, uh, Ukraine,
uh, Asia, uh, South America who

1149
01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:18.215
<v Deb Goodkin>are contributing to the project.

1150
01:01:19.362 --> 01:01:22.588
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so you have, so you

1151
01:01:22.648 --> 01:01:26.015
<v Deb Goodkin>have different cultures, uh, and,
and it's interesting.

1152
01:01:26.541 --> 01:01:30.594
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, you know, it's, it's
interesting.

1153
01:01:31.061 --> 01:01:35.873
<v Deb Goodkin>I think it's really important for
us to figure out how to work well

1154
01:01:35.934 --> 01:01:36.335
<v Deb Goodkin>together.

1155
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.866
<v Deb Goodkin>And one thing that I learned when

1156
01:01:39.886 --> 01:01:45.321
<v Deb Goodkin>I went to my first European
conference was, um, I'm trying to

1157
01:01:45.341 --> 01:01:48.312
<v Deb Goodkin>remember what country we were in
Malta, maybe.

1158
01:01:49.522 --> 01:01:53.591
<v Deb Goodkin>And we had this guy who, he
organized the European conference

1159
01:01:53.912 --> 01:01:56.063
<v Deb Goodkin>and he asked me what I thought.

1160
01:01:56.641 --> 01:01:59.486
<v Deb Goodkin>And I said, and I told him, I go,

1161
01:01:59.486 --> 01:02:04.702
<v Deb Goodkin>"I'm just exhausted because
everyone has accents and it's so

1162
01:02:04.742 --> 01:02:09.308
<v Deb Goodkin>hard to understand."
And he goes, "but just think most

1163
01:02:09.328 --> 01:02:13.245
<v Deb Goodkin>of these people are native English
speakers and how hard it is for

1164
01:02:13.245 --> 01:02:15.725
<v Deb Goodkin>them."
And after he said that, I was

1165
01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:21.667
<v Deb Goodkin>like, "yeah, I mean, what am I
tired about?" Like I'm, they're

1166
01:02:21.707 --> 01:02:23.112
<v Deb Goodkin>speaking my language to me.

1167
01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.168
<v Deb Goodkin>I don't have to deal with it being

1168
01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:26.112
<v Deb Goodkin>my second language.

1169
01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:30.290
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, so those are, that was

1170
01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:32.274
<v Deb Goodkin>a real important lesson to me.

1171
01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.427
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so, but it's, but

1172
01:02:36.467 --> 01:02:42.021
<v Deb Goodkin>I've, I learned from our community
and I, and I just find it so

1173
01:02:42.081 --> 01:02:46.293
<v Deb Goodkin>interesting, especially when we
have this opportunity to go, we go

1174
01:02:46.313 --> 01:02:49.826
<v Deb Goodkin>to a different country in Europe
every year for a conference and

1175
01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:56.168
<v Deb Goodkin>learning about, um, you know,
their culture and, um, and meeting

1176
01:02:56.228 --> 01:02:57.071
<v Deb Goodkin>local people there.

1177
01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.469
<v Deb Goodkin>And that's, uh, that's been really

1178
01:02:59.529 --> 01:03:00.071
<v Deb Goodkin>educational.

1179
01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.043
<v Deb Goodkin>So, I mean, so we've gone to like

1180
01:03:02.244 --> 01:03:10.204
<v Deb Goodkin>Malta, Bulgaria, uh, Romania, uh,
Norway, Sweden, Germany, France,

1181
01:03:10.885 --> 01:03:17.716
<v Deb Goodkin>um, you know, England, uh, Japan,
Taiwan, we'll be in Taiwan next

1182
01:03:17.776 --> 01:03:17.976
<v Deb Goodkin>year.

1183
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.389
<v Deb Goodkin>Uh, and so all these opportunities

1184
01:03:23.572 --> 01:03:24.955
<v Deb Goodkin>to meet people from around the
world.

1185
01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:30.071
<v Deb Goodkin>And once, and also once we went
and started doing these virtual

1186
01:03:30.131 --> 01:03:34.747
<v Deb Goodkin>conferences because of COVID, um,
people who normally couldn't

1187
01:03:34.787 --> 01:03:38.323
<v Deb Goodkin>travel, it finally gave them the
opportunity to, to attend some of

1188
01:03:38.343 --> 01:03:40.071
<v Deb Goodkin>these conferences, which was
really nice.

1189
01:03:42.229 --> 01:03:42.851
<v Karen Herman>That's terrific.

1190
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.910
<v Karen Herman>Did, um, how did COVID impact, uh,

1191
01:03:46.091 --> 01:03:52.189
<v Karen Herman>your work?
So, um, so most of us were already

1192
01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:58.605
<v Deb Goodkin>working from home and, um, and so
the impacts were, uh, uh, with our

1193
01:03:58.685 --> 01:04:03.156
<v Deb Goodkin>interns who are working in our
office in Kitchener, Ontario.

1194
01:04:03.721 --> 01:04:09.975
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, so we have a, uh, intern
or, um, there's a co-op program

1195
01:04:10.115 --> 01:04:12.931
<v Deb Goodkin>through the University of Waterloo
that we participate in, which has

1196
01:04:12.971 --> 01:04:13.252
<v Deb Goodkin>been great.

1197
01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:15.404
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, I think we had three

1198
01:04:16.046 --> 01:04:20.923
<v Deb Goodkin>interns and so they're all college
students and they were working in

1199
01:04:20.963 --> 01:04:21.728
<v Deb Goodkin>our office there.

1200
01:04:21.728 --> 01:04:22.763
<v Deb Goodkin>So we have their computer setups

1201
01:04:22.803 --> 01:04:28.095
<v Deb Goodkin>there and they, and not all of
them were from the Kitchener area

1202
01:04:28.361 --> 01:04:28.583
<v Deb Goodkin>either.

1203
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.846
<v Deb Goodkin>And so we had to figure out how we

1204
01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:38.423
<v Deb Goodkin>can set them up to work from home,
get them home and, um, and help

1205
01:04:38.464 --> 01:04:45.995
<v Deb Goodkin>them navigate working online and
having to get their, like their

1206
01:04:46.376 --> 01:04:49.552
<v Deb Goodkin>supervision or mentoring online.

1207
01:04:49.821 --> 01:04:53.367
<v Deb Goodkin>So, um, so that, so that took an

1208
01:04:53.768 --> 01:04:59.221
<v Deb Goodkin>effort to figure out after that,
after once we had finished that

1209
01:04:59.261 --> 01:05:04.194
<v Deb Goodkin>term and had another term, we were
set up then, um, on how to do

1210
01:05:04.254 --> 01:05:04.435
<v Deb Goodkin>that.

1211
01:05:04.435 --> 01:05:06.408
<v Deb Goodkin>And so we're pretty much set up

1212
01:05:06.448 --> 01:05:07.552
<v Deb Goodkin>now to do that.

1213
01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.145
<v Deb Goodkin>And then really the other thing

1214
01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:10.611
<v Deb Goodkin>was, was travel.

1215
01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:12.649
<v Deb Goodkin>And what do we do about travel?

1216
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.071
<v Deb Goodkin>Because we had been traveling, uh,
to, like I was saying, around the

1217
01:05:17.112 --> 01:05:20.189
<v Deb Goodkin>world, attending different
conferences, giving workshops,

1218
01:05:20.269 --> 01:05:20.872
<v Deb Goodkin>things like that.

1219
01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.330
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so what do we do?

1220
01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:27.913
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and what are our
responsibilities as a corporation?

1221
01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:32.071
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so really understanding that
as well as like what were the

1222
01:05:32.131 --> 01:05:35.899
<v Deb Goodkin>government mandates and all that
kind of stuff, understanding that,

1223
01:05:36.046 --> 01:05:40.583
<v Deb Goodkin>understanding to our investments
and what could happen because we,

1224
01:05:40.985 --> 01:05:44.454
<v Deb Goodkin>we try to keep enough money to pay
salaries for one to two years.

1225
01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:48.591
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, you know, and the stock
market dropped, you know, those

1226
01:05:48.631 --> 01:05:49.413
<v Deb Goodkin>first few days.

1227
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:53.727
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, so it really made me

1228
01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:58.902
<v Deb Goodkin>spend a lot of time understanding
and figuring out putting together

1229
01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:00.168
<v Deb Goodkin>some plans, talking to people.

1230
01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.984
<v Deb Goodkin>And also I was talking to people

1231
01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:05.694
<v Deb Goodkin>from other companies, bigger
companies, like, are you

1232
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:06.982
<v Deb Goodkin>traveling?
Are you going to go to this

1233
01:06:07.002 --> 01:06:09.872
<v Deb Goodkin>conference that's still happening
to give a talk?

1234
01:06:10.441 --> 01:06:14.511
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so, um, so most of the
people would say, no, our, you

1235
01:06:14.531 --> 01:06:16.845
<v Deb Goodkin>know, companies have travel
restrictions now.

1236
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.473
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so then it was like, we
could have travel restrictions

1237
01:06:21.513 --> 01:06:21.653
<v Deb Goodkin>too.

1238
01:06:22.584 --> 01:06:24.010
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so we did do that.

1239
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:31.833
<v Deb Goodkin>And also, um, making sure
employees felt that, um, they

1240
01:06:32.714 --> 01:06:36.530
<v Deb Goodkin>didn't have to travel, that we
were making sure protections were

1241
01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:37.072
<v Deb Goodkin>in place too.

1242
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.106
<v Deb Goodkin>And even now, um, that in person

1243
01:06:40.146 --> 01:06:44.535
<v Deb Goodkin>conferences are happening again,
um, not everyone is comfortable

1244
01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.525
<v Deb Goodkin>traveling yet.

1245
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.645
<v Deb Goodkin>And I know I've been traveling,

1246
01:06:47.745 --> 01:06:51.254
<v Deb Goodkin>but also I'm very careful right
now about getting exposed.

1247
01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:57.013
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I'm one of those who still
wears a mask, but, but that's my

1248
01:06:57.033 --> 01:06:57.454
<v Deb Goodkin>decision.

1249
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.226
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, if someone on my team is

1250
01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:04.463
<v Deb Goodkin>not comfortable traveling or being
in a big conference setting, then

1251
01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:05.128
<v Deb Goodkin>that's okay.

1252
01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:09.408
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so, um, uh, so we make sure

1253
01:07:09.508 --> 01:07:14.281
<v Deb Goodkin>that, um, you know, that we're,
uh, there's, I don't think there's

1254
01:07:14.502 --> 01:07:17.492
<v Deb Goodkin>anything that we have to do that
we have to actually go and be

1255
01:07:17.552 --> 01:07:20.311
<v Deb Goodkin>physical at, we've done everything
online, which is great.

1256
01:07:22.448 --> 01:07:23.131
<v Karen Herman>That's really cool.

1257
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.723
<v Karen Herman>Um, you had mentioned, you'd

1258
01:07:24.784 --> 01:07:28.074
<v Karen Herman>mentioned, um, that the
originators of FreeBSD are still

1259
01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.353
<v Karen Herman>very involved in, in the
foundation.

1260
01:07:32.353 --> 01:07:33.568
<v Karen Herman>Can Can you talk about some of
those people?

1261
01:07:35.107 --> 01:07:35.528
<v Deb Goodkin>Yes.

1262
01:07:36.361 --> 01:07:37.707
<v Deb Goodkin>And hopefully you'll get their

1263
01:07:37.767 --> 01:07:38.550
<v Deb Goodkin>stories too.

1264
01:07:39.081 --> 01:07:40.748
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, cause there's some great

1265
01:07:40.788 --> 01:07:41.391
<v Deb Goodkin>stories there.

1266
01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:45.612
<v Deb Goodkin>Kirk McKusick, um, he's, he came

1267
01:07:45.632 --> 01:07:46.134
<v Deb Goodkin>from Berkeley.

1268
01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.806
<v Deb Goodkin>He was a PhD student when, I

1269
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:53.221
<v Deb Goodkin>always want to say playing around
with, uh, the Berkeley Annex, but

1270
01:07:53.241 --> 01:07:56.852
<v Deb Goodkin>really, I mean, it was, uh, it was
a product that companies were

1271
01:07:56.992 --> 01:07:59.749
<v Deb Goodkin>using in their, um, doing research
with it.

1272
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:06.592
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, so he's one of the
original people on, um, on BSD,

1273
01:08:06.632 --> 01:08:08.925
<v Deb Goodkin>Berkeley Annex, as well as in
FreeBSD.

1274
01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.570
<v Deb Goodkin>But when you talk to him, he'll
say, "well, I wasn't one of the

1275
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:17.825
<v Deb Goodkin>first, uh, people on FreeBSD
because there was actually a

1276
01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:21.863
<v Deb Goodkin>lawsuit that was happening at the
time and against Berkeley Annex.

1277
01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:28.633
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so for like two
years, I think, um, the developers

1278
01:08:28.673 --> 01:08:34.192
<v Deb Goodkin>from Berkeley, the students
mostly, um, had to, um, had to

1279
01:08:34.232 --> 01:08:37.984
<v Deb Goodkin>focus on that."
And, uh, so FreeBSD had branched

1280
01:08:38.185 --> 01:08:42.754
<v Deb Goodkin>out and from then there was
FreeBSD and NetBSD at the

1281
01:08:42.794 --> 01:08:43.234
<v Deb Goodkin>beginning.

1282
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.064
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, so some of those folks,

1283
01:08:46.746 --> 01:08:51.800
<v Deb Goodkin>uh, Jordan Hubbard, Rodney Grimes,
some other folks that, um,

1284
01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:56.912
<v Deb Goodkin>hopefully we'll get some, um,
recordings from them to hear their

1285
01:08:56.953 --> 01:08:57.474
<v Deb Goodkin>stories too.

1286
01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:01.026
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, but they were part of FreeBSD

1287
01:09:01.046 --> 01:09:07.826
<v Deb Goodkin>when it first, um, you know,
started out in 1993, which we're

1288
01:09:07.866 --> 01:09:10.013
<v Deb Goodkin>celebrating the 30th anniversary
of this year.

1289
01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:13.392
<v Karen Herman>And when did you join the
foundation?

1290
01:09:14.243 --> 01:09:15.452
<v Deb Goodkin>So I joined in 2005.

1291
01:09:18.465 --> 01:09:20.169
<v Karen Herman>And so, so since then, like what,

1292
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:23.161
<v Karen Herman>what, um, what kind of changes
have you seen just in the

1293
01:09:23.301 --> 01:09:26.680
<v Karen Herman>community and, and, you know,
there's just, I mean, um, it's 18

1294
01:09:27.252 --> 01:09:27.392
<v Karen Herman>years.

1295
01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.029
<v Karen Herman>So what, what, what's changed?

1296
01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:30.807
<v Deb Goodkin>I know it's I know it's a long
time.

1297
01:09:31.804 --> 01:09:33.551
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, I've seen it grow.

1298
01:09:34.844 --> 01:09:36.611
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, yeah, I've seen more people

1299
01:09:36.731 --> 01:09:36.932
<v Deb Goodkin>join.

1300
01:09:36.979 --> 01:09:39.207
<v Deb Goodkin>I've seen more younger people join

1301
01:09:39.228 --> 01:09:40.591
<v Deb Goodkin>too, which has been really cool.

1302
01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:41.883
<v Deb Goodkin>And that's something that we're

1303
01:09:41.923 --> 01:09:44.310
<v Deb Goodkin>really trying to increase too.

1304
01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:46.848
<v Deb Goodkin>So we're learning from them too,

1305
01:09:46.868 --> 01:09:47.330
<v Deb Goodkin>which is great.

1306
01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.425
<v Deb Goodkin>Like why, why would you be

1307
01:09:49.444 --> 01:09:53.783
<v Deb Goodkin>interested in, uh, contributing to
FreeBSD or learning about FreeBSD?

1308
01:09:55.663 --> 01:10:00.732
<v Deb Goodkin>The other things from the
foundation perspective is, uh,

1309
01:10:00.812 --> 01:10:02.776
<v Deb Goodkin>we're just funding so much more
work.

1310
01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.929
<v Deb Goodkin>We're bringing in a lot more
money.

1311
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.490
<v Deb Goodkin>And like I said earlier on, when I
first joined the foundation, I was

1312
01:10:08.531 --> 01:10:09.093
<v Deb Goodkin>part-time.

1313
01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.646
<v Deb Goodkin>And so until I start bringing in

1314
01:10:11.706 --> 01:10:15.724
<v Deb Goodkin>the funds, I stayed part-time,
which I was fine with at the time.

1315
01:10:17.624 --> 01:10:21.413
<v Deb Goodkin>And so as we brought in more
money, then we were able to hire

1316
01:10:21.533 --> 01:10:22.095
<v Deb Goodkin>more people.

1317
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.347
<v Deb Goodkin>So, uh, we brought in, um, Ed

1318
01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:29.641
<v Deb Goodkin>Maust who now oversees all of our
development work, but he, at the

1319
01:10:29.681 --> 01:10:34.112
<v Deb Goodkin>time, uh, he was doing, he was,
uh, doing software development

1320
01:10:34.393 --> 01:10:35.483
<v Deb Goodkin>work himself for us.

1321
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.664
<v Deb Goodkin>We hired a marketing director and

1322
01:10:37.684 --> 01:10:42.201
<v Deb Goodkin>that's when we started providing
all that advocacy material and the

1323
01:10:42.341 --> 01:10:44.812
<v Deb Goodkin>online content and stuff like
that.

1324
01:10:45.562 --> 01:10:49.713
<v Deb Goodkin>And then since, since then, um,
we've hired more software

1325
01:10:49.733 --> 01:10:50.194
<v Deb Goodkin>developers.

1326
01:10:50.401 --> 01:10:51.507
<v Deb Goodkin>We've built our marketing.

1327
01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:58.593
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, and also we're identifying
other, um, positions that would

1328
01:10:58.613 --> 01:10:59.876
<v Deb Goodkin>really help the project.

1329
01:11:00.621 --> 01:11:03.047
<v Deb Goodkin>And I just hired, uh, someone

1330
01:11:03.107 --> 01:11:06.801
<v Deb Goodkin>who's, who just stepped in as our
director of partnership and

1331
01:11:06.842 --> 01:11:07.285
<v Deb Goodkin>research.

1332
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.505
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, and that's really gonna

1333
01:11:10.605 --> 01:11:17.384
<v Deb Goodkin>help, um, like nurture and build
these relationships that we have

1334
01:11:17.544 --> 01:11:18.328
<v Deb Goodkin>with companies.

1335
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.848
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, as well as helping get

1336
01:11:22.888 --> 01:11:26.722
<v Deb Goodkin>more companies, uh, to learn about
previous D and why they should

1337
01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:27.387
<v Deb Goodkin>adopt it.

1338
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.204
<v Deb Goodkin>And so have someone who could

1339
01:11:29.265 --> 01:11:32.894
<v Deb Goodkin>full-time work on that because
that was my job before.

1340
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.130
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and it's just hard to do, to
run the organization and to, um,

1341
01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:41.731
<v Deb Goodkin>you know, be able to to follow up
on, on that type of stuff.

1342
01:11:43.002 --> 01:11:47.272
<v Deb Goodkin>And the research component of that
is really, um, part of it is

1343
01:11:47.332 --> 01:11:49.727
<v Deb Goodkin>policy to where, what should we
get we get involved with?

1344
01:11:49.841 --> 01:11:52.863
<v Deb Goodkin>There's a lot of cybersecurity
stuff going on now.

1345
01:11:52.863 --> 01:11:57.062
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, you know, making sure, um, our
voices or our voice is included in

1346
01:11:57.062 --> 01:11:59.453
<v Deb Goodkin>some of the government, uh,
discussions.

1347
01:11:59.453 --> 01:12:03.459
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, also what are the trends
that are happening out there and

1348
01:12:03.459 --> 01:12:07.304
<v Deb Goodkin>what should we be involved with?
And, um, as well as looking at

1349
01:12:07.304 --> 01:12:11.172
<v Deb Goodkin>like what research is happening
with freeBSD, there's a a lot of

1350
01:12:11.172 --> 01:12:13.778
<v Deb Goodkin>security work that's happening
with freeBSD.

1351
01:12:13.778 --> 01:12:17.754
<v Deb Goodkin>And so not only spending the time
doing that, but, um, publicizing

1352
01:12:17.754 --> 01:12:18.108
<v Deb Goodkin>that.

1353
01:12:18.108 --> 01:12:19.746
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, so users know and

1354
01:12:19.746 --> 01:12:23.852
<v Deb Goodkin>universities know and corporations
know that freeBSD is a really good

1355
01:12:23.852 --> 01:12:25.482
<v Deb Goodkin>solution for like security.

1356
01:12:25.482 --> 01:12:27.227
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, well with Earth Day

1357
01:12:27.227 --> 01:12:30.326
<v Deb Goodkin>tomorrow, um, yeah, low power
consumption being more

1358
01:12:30.326 --> 01:12:31.786
<v Deb Goodkin>environmentally friendly.

1359
01:12:31.786 --> 01:12:33.586
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, so things like that.

1360
01:12:33.586 --> 01:12:37.484
<v Deb Goodkin>So, so we're looking at growing
the team in ways like that, that

1361
01:12:37.484 --> 01:12:38.815
<v Deb Goodkin>helps freeBSD overall.

1362
01:12:38.815 --> 01:12:40.614
<v Deb Goodkin>So that's so how we've grown.

1363
01:12:40.614 --> 01:12:43.774
<v Deb Goodkin>So we have, I don't know, eight,
nine employees now.

1364
01:12:43.774 --> 01:12:47.704
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, and then as far as the growth
of the project, just, um, more

1365
01:12:47.704 --> 01:12:51.049
<v Deb Goodkin>companies using freeBSD or
companies coming out of there

1366
01:12:51.049 --> 01:12:54.863
<v Deb Goodkin>would work too that have been
using freeBSD that we didn't know

1367
01:12:54.863 --> 01:12:58.377
<v Deb Goodkin>about because it's not like we
have this product and we're

1368
01:12:58.377 --> 01:12:59.085
<v Deb Goodkin>selling it.

1369
01:12:59.085 --> 01:13:01.215
<v Deb Goodkin>So we know all the users out there

1370
01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:02.361
<v Deb Goodkin>that are using it.

1371
01:13:02.361 --> 01:13:04.375
<v Deb Goodkin>It's the license allows anyone to

1372
01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:07.751
<v Deb Goodkin>use freeBSD and to make whatever
changes that they want.

1373
01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:11.726
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, so there's products out
there that are using freeBSD that

1374
01:13:11.726 --> 01:13:12.765
<v Deb Goodkin>we have no idea.

1375
01:13:12.765 --> 01:13:14.703
<v Deb Goodkin>We would love to know, but they

1376
01:13:14.703 --> 01:13:16.341
<v Deb Goodkin>don't have to let us know.

1377
01:13:16.341 --> 01:13:18.409
<v Deb Goodkin>That's not their, that's not their

1378
01:13:18.409 --> 01:13:18.978
<v Deb Goodkin>priority.

1379
01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:20.831
<v Deb Goodkin>So, um, so anyway, so learning

1380
01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:23.930
<v Deb Goodkin>about those uses are interesting
and really helpful.

1381
01:13:47.786 --> 01:13:53.411
<v Karen Herman>What is your biggest challenge?
Um, I would say the biggest

1382
01:13:53.452 --> 01:13:56.080
<v Deb Goodkin>challenge that, well, a couple of
things, uh, one is for the

1383
01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:56.120
<v Deb Goodkin>project, one's for us.

1384
01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:56.704
<v Deb Goodkin>So one would be getting the money

1385
01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.169
<v Deb Goodkin>that to do this work, to fund the
work.

1386
01:13:59.941 --> 01:14:06.277
<v Deb Goodkin>Cause we, there's, there's so many
things we know we can help with

1387
01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:06.959
<v Deb Goodkin>and we just don't have the
resources to do it.

1388
01:14:06.959 --> 01:14:07.069
<v Deb Goodkin>know we can help with have the
resources to do it.

1389
01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.465
<v Deb Goodkin>And, uh, we have these
conversations all the time, like,

1390
01:14:09.947 --> 01:14:17.957
<v Deb Goodkin>oh, if we had someone who could
step in to do this, that would be

1391
01:14:18.038 --> 01:14:18.559
<v Deb Goodkin>so beneficial.

1392
01:14:18.665 --> 01:14:21.132
<v Deb Goodkin>And, but we can't, can't do it

1393
01:14:21.192 --> 01:14:22.014
<v Deb Goodkin>cause we don't have the funding.

1394
01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.924
<v Deb Goodkin>So really is getting that funding

1395
01:14:24.105 --> 01:14:27.554
<v Deb Goodkin>and having the director of
partnerships will, will really

1396
01:14:27.621 --> 01:14:28.085
<v Deb Goodkin>help that.

1397
01:14:28.842 --> 01:14:30.706
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, and then the other challenge

1398
01:14:31.127 --> 01:14:35.505
<v Deb Goodkin>is within the project that because
it's a volunteer organization is

1399
01:14:35.806 --> 01:14:37.673
<v Deb Goodkin>getting people to do certain
things.

1400
01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.269
<v Deb Goodkin>So, you know, if you're a
volunteer and you're working on

1401
01:14:41.309 --> 01:14:44.507
<v Deb Goodkin>here on this project because you
love it, you're passionate about

1402
01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:44.607
<v Deb Goodkin>it.

1403
01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.028
<v Deb Goodkin>But maybe there's like some boring

1404
01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Deb Goodkin>task.

1405
01:14:48.161 --> 01:14:48.302
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah.

1406
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.430
<v Deb Goodkin>Well, there's a lot of boring
tasks that have to be done.

1407
01:14:51.165 --> 01:14:51.346
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah.

1408
01:14:51.401 --> 01:14:52.325
<v Deb Goodkin>Do you really want to spend your

1409
01:14:52.346 --> 01:14:54.727
<v Deb Goodkin>time on that?
You want to do the exciting

1410
01:14:54.788 --> 01:14:55.069
<v Deb Goodkin>things.

1411
01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.446
<v Deb Goodkin>So, um, so a lot of times it's

1412
01:14:58.466 --> 01:15:02.763
<v Deb Goodkin>hard to find people to do more of
the tactical type of things.

1413
01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.210
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and that's where actually
we try to step in and help with,

1414
01:15:07.631 --> 01:15:13.149
<v Deb Goodkin>and, um, you know, is, is to, you
know, fill those holes where you

1415
01:15:13.169 --> 01:15:17.648
<v Deb Goodkin>can't get a volunteer, but, um,
but going back to the funding, we

1416
01:15:17.688 --> 01:15:18.531
<v Deb Goodkin>can't always do that.

1417
01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.365
<v Deb Goodkin>So I'd say like, those are the two

1418
01:15:20.385 --> 01:15:22.032
<v Deb Goodkin>biggest challenge challenges.

1419
01:15:24.426 --> 01:15:25.729
<v Karen Herman>What do you think your leadership,

1420
01:15:26.190 --> 01:15:29.020
<v Karen Herman>your leadership style is?
Oh, mine?

1421
01:15:30.846 --> 01:15:33.313
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, I haven't really thought about
that.

1422
01:15:34.362 --> 01:15:39.755
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, I, I'm pretty down to earth
person.

1423
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.152
<v Deb Goodkin>So I'm not, I don't know, pushy
would be the word.

1424
01:15:44.301 --> 01:15:52.635
<v Deb Goodkin>I try to listen to, um, I listen
and watch the staff, you know,

1425
01:15:52.675 --> 01:15:56.126
<v Deb Goodkin>what are their needs?
What am I seeing that maybe they

1426
01:15:56.146 --> 01:15:58.693
<v Deb Goodkin>need help with and, and ask
questions.

1427
01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:05.232
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and I really try to make
sure that I think it's really

1428
01:16:05.252 --> 01:16:08.727
<v Deb Goodkin>important to have a good life work
balance.

1429
01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:16.335
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so I make sure that
we're as accommodating as we can

1430
01:16:16.375 --> 01:16:16.475
<v Deb Goodkin>be.

1431
01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:20.147
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and because we are remote and

1432
01:16:20.247 --> 01:16:24.785
<v Deb Goodkin>most people, everyone works from
home, um, it is easier to do that.

1433
01:16:25.624 --> 01:16:27.472
<v Deb Goodkin>I've always loved working from
home.

1434
01:16:29.103 --> 01:16:35.136
<v Deb Goodkin>So, I mean, I love to not having a
commute, just that hour, what can

1435
01:16:35.156 --> 01:16:38.971
<v Deb Goodkin>you do that hour?
Um, and I love being able to just

1436
01:16:39.072 --> 01:16:40.737
<v Deb Goodkin>get up and start working at seven.

1437
01:16:41.586 --> 01:16:43.331
<v Deb Goodkin>So then I, like I was saying, so I

1438
01:16:43.351 --> 01:16:44.655
<v Deb Goodkin>can go for a run or whatever.

1439
01:16:44.655 --> 01:16:48.108
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, so, so for me, it's

1440
01:16:48.128 --> 01:16:52.983
<v Deb Goodkin>really being available, listening,
um, and asking questions of, you

1441
01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:55.053
<v Deb Goodkin>of, you know, what are your
challenges?

1442
01:16:55.053 --> 01:16:58.593
<v Deb Goodkin>What do you like?
You know, what, what are you doing

1443
01:16:58.633 --> 01:17:02.571
<v Deb Goodkin>that you really don't like?
And, um, and then trying to work

1444
01:17:02.611 --> 01:17:05.629
<v Deb Goodkin>with them on making sure people
are doing what they're interested

1445
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639
<v Deb Goodkin>in.

1446
01:17:05.639 --> 01:17:08.650
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, you know, cause they

1447
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:11.684
<v Deb Goodkin>can't, we have a lot of jobs or
tasks that we have to do that

1448
01:17:12.566 --> 01:17:16.596
<v Deb Goodkin>maybe aren't the things that we
love, just like what I was saying

1449
01:17:16.616 --> 01:17:17.338
<v Deb Goodkin>with the volunteers, but they have
to be done.

1450
01:17:17.448 --> 01:17:20.677
<v Deb Goodkin>So making sure there's a good
balance there too.

1451
01:17:20.677 --> 01:17:25.736
<v Karen Herman>Have you had any challenges in
your career, um, being a woman in

1452
01:17:25.756 --> 01:17:28.022
<v Karen Herman>sort of a man dominated field?
Um, well, yeah, I have, um, I

1453
01:17:28.383 --> 01:17:40.367
<v Deb Goodkin>mean, even, you know, starting out
in college, um, there weren't that

1454
01:17:40.387 --> 01:17:45.619
<v Deb Goodkin>many women in, who are studying
any, any of those disciplines, uh,

1455
01:17:45.639 --> 01:17:49.866
<v Deb Goodkin>computer science, engineering,
computer engineering, and math.

1456
01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:51.934
<v Deb Goodkin>Cause those were, I think the
areas that I touched on.

1457
01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:55.927
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, but I also found that because
it was such a hard discipline that

1458
01:17:55.947 --> 01:18:03.128
<v Deb Goodkin>we really worked together to
understand things that we had.

1459
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.210
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, I mean, maybe you didn't have
Google back then, but yeah, we had

1460
01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:13.490
<v Deb Goodkin>our own working group that spent a
lot of time together.

1461
01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:19.235
<v Deb Goodkin>And so sometimes, so there might
be six of us and really just

1462
01:18:19.315 --> 01:18:21.692
<v Deb Goodkin>teaching each other concepts, if
someone doesn't understand it.

1463
01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:26.377
<v Deb Goodkin>So maybe I'd have another woman in
there or maybe I'd be the only one

1464
01:18:26.437 --> 01:18:30.176
<v Deb Goodkin>and didn't really matter because
we were all, we all felt like

1465
01:18:30.196 --> 01:18:30.899
<v Deb Goodkin>we're in the same boat.

1466
01:18:30.899 --> 01:18:30.909
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah.

1467
01:18:30.909 --> 01:18:30.959
<v Deb Goodkin>Just trying to, to swim.

1468
01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:35.889
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, there's definitely companies,

1469
01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:42.406
<v Deb Goodkin>uh, where it was hard, um, from
being discriminated, discriminated

1470
01:18:42.507 --> 01:18:49.164
<v Deb Goodkin>against, um, to, you know, being
in sales, being part of sales and

1471
01:18:49.605 --> 01:18:53.174
<v Deb Goodkin>being at social events, uh, you
have to, I felt like I always had

1472
01:18:53.174 --> 01:18:59.913
<v Deb Goodkin>to to be, um, aware and, um, I
feel like that in life, uh, you

1473
01:18:59.954 --> 01:19:03.089
<v Deb Goodkin>have to be aware of your
surroundings and people around you

1474
01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.411
<v Deb Goodkin>anyway.

1475
01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.228
<v Deb Goodkin>So I don't think that that's any

1476
01:19:05.268 --> 01:19:05.670
<v Deb Goodkin>different.

1477
01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:09.809
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, but definitely have always

1478
01:19:09.889 --> 01:19:12.474
<v Deb Goodkin>felt that I had to work harder to
do the same thing.

1479
01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:17.812
<v Deb Goodkin>And other people got recognition
where, um, the standards were

1480
01:19:17.832 --> 01:19:18.514
<v Deb Goodkin>definitely lowered.

1481
01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:20.483
<v Deb Goodkin>And what I always found

1482
01:19:20.543 --> 01:19:24.312
<v Deb Goodkin>interesting was when people
started complaining about having

1483
01:19:24.332 --> 01:19:30.493
<v Deb Goodkin>to have that diversity of making
sure you have, yeah, bring more

1484
01:19:30.533 --> 01:19:30.814
<v Deb Goodkin>women.

1485
01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.509
<v Deb Goodkin>And I'll use that as an example of

1486
01:19:32.529 --> 01:19:32.650
<v Deb Goodkin>that.

1487
01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:33.967
<v Deb Goodkin>You have to lower standards for

1488
01:19:34.008 --> 01:19:34.189
<v Deb Goodkin>that.

1489
01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.923
<v Deb Goodkin>And it's like, I'm thinking, I

1490
01:19:36.525 --> 01:19:41.901
<v Deb Goodkin>think it's the opposite because
I've, I've seen, um, you know, in

1491
01:19:41.981 --> 01:19:47.853
<v Deb Goodkin>many of, um, you know, my jobs
that people were recognized and

1492
01:19:47.893 --> 01:19:51.610
<v Deb Goodkin>praised for not doing a very good
job because there was a lot of

1493
01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:52.212
<v Deb Goodkin>competition.

1494
01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.305
<v Deb Goodkin>So I think having more women, um,

1495
01:19:54.886 --> 01:19:58.641
<v Deb Goodkin>does bring in more competition and
it's just really, how do we get

1496
01:19:58.681 --> 01:20:04.075
<v Deb Goodkin>more women first interested in
like STEM fields?

1497
01:20:04.863 --> 01:20:06.791
<v Deb Goodkin>And then the second would be
staying.

1498
01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:13.255
<v Deb Goodkin>So, cause I, I left and, um, and
cause it, it, it, it's hard.

1499
01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:14.487
<v Deb Goodkin>It's not really giving up.

1500
01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.525
<v Deb Goodkin>It's like, you look at your life

1501
01:20:17.107 --> 01:20:19.574
<v Deb Goodkin>and you look at what do I want to
do?

1502
01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:25.791
<v Deb Goodkin>What do I want to deal with?
And, um, and so maybe you take a

1503
01:20:25.811 --> 01:20:27.074
<v Deb Goodkin>step back for a little bit.

1504
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.508
<v Deb Goodkin>I got back into tech and, um, and

1505
01:20:32.528 --> 01:20:38.943
<v Deb Goodkin>yeah, things still happen, but,
um, but I'm seeing being back in

1506
01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:43.092
<v Deb Goodkin>tech and going to like these women
and competing conferences from,

1507
01:20:43.112 --> 01:20:48.851
<v Deb Goodkin>uh, like Grace Hopper to, we have,
um, ECM puts on these celebrations

1508
01:20:48.911 --> 01:20:50.883
<v Deb Goodkin>of women competing all around the
world.

1509
01:20:52.162 --> 01:20:58.353
<v Deb Goodkin>And first seeing these students,
seeing the speakers, it's, uh, so

1510
01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:05.310
<v Deb Goodkin>inspirational that there's a lot
of women in STEM and, um, but I

1511
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:07.975
<v Deb Goodkin>know in operating systems, it is
hard.

1512
01:21:08.461 --> 01:21:11.892
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and I, and I don't know
why.

1513
01:21:12.761 --> 01:21:15.809
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so trying to figure
that out and how to make it, um,

1514
01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:21.831
<v Deb Goodkin>you know, attract more people, um,
is, uh, yeah, it's one of the

1515
01:21:21.851 --> 01:21:23.275
<v Deb Goodkin>things that we're trying to work
on.

1516
01:21:26.445 --> 01:21:29.714
<v Karen Herman>What do you think has been your,
um, greatest achievement so far in

1517
01:21:29.734 --> 01:21:33.491
<v Karen Herman>the field?
Well, so in the field or with the

1518
01:21:33.531 --> 01:21:36.548
<v Deb Goodkin>foundation?
Um, Um, first let's go first in

1519
01:21:36.568 --> 01:21:38.253
<v Karen Herman>the field and then, and then the
foundation.

1520
01:21:38.253 --> 01:21:39.185
<v Karen Herman>I'd love that.

1521
01:21:39.981 --> 01:21:47.629
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, so I would say, um, that for

1522
01:21:47.689 --> 01:21:56.285
<v Deb Goodkin>me, it's been telling my story to
girls and women at these type of

1523
01:21:56.305 --> 01:21:57.791
<v Deb Goodkin>women competing conferences.

1524
01:21:58.922 --> 01:22:02.809
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, I remember being at, uh,

1525
01:22:02.889 --> 01:22:06.776
<v Deb Goodkin>there's a conference in Europe
called Women Courage and it's put

1526
01:22:06.861 --> 01:22:07.727
<v Deb Goodkin>on by ACM.

1527
01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.383
<v Deb Goodkin>It's their, uh, it's their

1528
01:22:09.544 --> 01:22:14.315
<v Deb Goodkin>European women, celebration of
women in computing conference.

1529
01:22:15.001 --> 01:22:19.052
<v Deb Goodkin>And I remember I was staffing a
table and, and so I was there to

1530
01:22:19.092 --> 01:22:23.268
<v Deb Goodkin>promote FreeBSD and trying to
encourage people to consider

1531
01:22:23.329 --> 01:22:24.993
<v Deb Goodkin>contributing or using FreeBSD.

1532
01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:29.567
<v Deb Goodkin>And I had so many women students

1533
01:22:29.968 --> 01:22:34.941
<v Deb Goodkin>come up to me and want to just
talk to me about my background and

1534
01:22:34.961 --> 01:22:36.589
<v Deb Goodkin>my history, sort of like what
we're doing here.

1535
01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:42.550
<v Deb Goodkin>And because a lot of times when
you go to these conferences, you

1536
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:49.653
<v Deb Goodkin>have, um, you don't have actual
like female, um, engineers there.

1537
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:53.690
<v Deb Goodkin>You'll have representatives of the
company and usually they're

1538
01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:56.125
<v Deb Goodkin>recruiters or marketing, which is
fine.

1539
01:22:56.942 --> 01:23:01.534
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, and so, but they don't, they
can't tell those types of stories.

1540
01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:07.172
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, uh, so, so much fun, um,
you know, being asked these

1541
01:23:07.212 --> 01:23:12.609
<v Deb Goodkin>questions and then also just how
excited they were about, um, you

1542
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:15.375
<v Deb Goodkin>know, the potential and the
opportunity.

1543
01:23:16.181 --> 01:23:21.475
<v Deb Goodkin>And, and so really that's what I
feel like is an achievement.

1544
01:23:22.543 --> 01:23:25.752
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and it's funny because
usually when you think of an

1545
01:23:25.772 --> 01:23:28.646
<v Deb Goodkin>achievement, you think of
something that you developed and,

1546
01:23:28.666 --> 01:23:30.793
<v Deb Goodkin>you know, and I developed disk
drives.

1547
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.611
<v Deb Goodkin>I want to say that they were great
and, um, implemented new features

1548
01:23:34.691 --> 01:23:35.474
<v Deb Goodkin>and stuff like that.

1549
01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.564
<v Deb Goodkin>But really what stands out to me

1550
01:23:37.744 --> 01:23:43.402
<v Deb Goodkin>is that being a role model or
someone who's available to talk

1551
01:23:43.442 --> 01:23:44.087
<v Deb Goodkin>about that.

1552
01:23:44.804 --> 01:23:45.809
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, of course you can do it.

1553
01:23:46.381 --> 01:23:48.250
<v Deb Goodkin>And cause I was never told that I
couldn't do it.

1554
01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.933
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and so it's really
finding, you know, what are you

1555
01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:58.286
<v Deb Goodkin>interested in?
And if you're, and you could be in

1556
01:23:58.347 --> 01:24:03.663
<v Deb Goodkin>tech and still, it doesn't have to
be like you're on a computer and

1557
01:24:03.683 --> 01:24:06.132
<v Deb Goodkin>your mom's face just programming
all day.

1558
01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:13.235
<v Deb Goodkin>It's, it can be so creative and,
um, and you can be outgoing.

1559
01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.968
<v Deb Goodkin>And I mean, there's so many
characteristics that aren't part

1560
01:24:17.008 --> 01:24:22.407
<v Deb Goodkin>of the stereotypical software
person that, and so, so if we can

1561
01:24:22.447 --> 01:24:27.343
<v Deb Goodkin>model that and, um, and show more
people who are like that, um, I

1562
01:24:27.383 --> 01:24:31.914
<v Deb Goodkin>think it'll really gain more
interest of, of girls and women in

1563
01:24:31.954 --> 01:24:32.295
<v Deb Goodkin>the field.

1564
01:24:34.264 --> 01:24:35.668
<v Karen Herman>Well, that's a great answer, but,

1565
01:24:35.748 --> 01:24:39.076
<v Karen Herman>uh, also what about your
achievement at, uh, FreeBSD

1566
01:24:39.185 --> 01:24:45.031
<v Karen Herman>Foundation?
Um, Um, so to me, I guess it would

1567
01:24:45.051 --> 01:24:48.344
<v Deb Goodkin>be growing the company because
like I said, I was the first

1568
01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:51.234
<v Deb Goodkin>employee, so we were hardly
anything at the time.

1569
01:24:51.234 --> 01:24:51.290
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, at the time.

1570
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:57.729
<v Deb Goodkin>And, um, and now we're this, uh,

1571
01:24:58.109 --> 01:25:04.261
<v Deb Goodkin>team of passionate people about
FreeBSD who can go to companies

1572
01:25:04.321 --> 01:25:08.233
<v Deb Goodkin>and talk to them who go around the
world giving talks of FreeBSD.

1573
01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:13.188
<v Deb Goodkin>A lot of times it's me and, um,
and I'm learning about FreeBSD

1574
01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:18.708
<v Deb Goodkin>and, um, and so what we've been
able to contribute back to the

1575
01:25:18.748 --> 01:25:19.250
<v Deb Goodkin>project.

1576
01:25:20.202 --> 01:25:21.966
<v Deb Goodkin>And by doing that into the world,

1577
01:25:22.066 --> 01:25:26.883
<v Deb Goodkin>because when you look at FreeBSD
as this product, um, I mean,

1578
01:25:27.103 --> 01:25:30.592
<v Deb Goodkin>companies use it and they benefit
from it, but it's this free

1579
01:25:30.772 --> 01:25:34.191
<v Deb Goodkin>operating system that anyone
around the world can use.

1580
01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:40.474
<v Deb Goodkin>And the hardware that it runs on
can be really cheap.

1581
01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:46.234
<v Deb Goodkin>So you can go into, you know,
underdeveloped countries.

1582
01:25:46.801 --> 01:25:49.509
<v Deb Goodkin>And I mean, we can't do this
because we don't have the

1583
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:51.454
<v Deb Goodkin>resources yet, but other people
could do it.

1584
01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.730
<v Deb Goodkin>And so you can, um, teach people
skills that will give them jobs

1585
01:25:57.472 --> 01:26:00.086
<v Deb Goodkin>and, um, you know, and make them
marketable.

1586
01:26:01.062 --> 01:26:05.914
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, so really as, as this free
product, there's so much potential

1587
01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:06.275
<v Deb Goodkin>for it.

1588
01:26:06.275 --> 01:26:08.811
<v Karen Herman>That's fantastic.

1589
01:26:09.441 --> 01:26:12.007
<v Karen Herman>Um, why do you think it's
important to, to, to be

1590
01:26:12.047 --> 01:26:15.155
<v Karen Herman>documenting the history of, of the
field?

1591
01:26:17.586 --> 01:26:20.734
<v Deb Goodkin>Well, I mean, the history of
everything, it's important.

1592
01:26:21.482 --> 01:26:24.632
<v Deb Goodkin>If it's not documented, then you
can change it.

1593
01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:25.663
<v Deb Goodkin>So, right.

1594
01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:28.847
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, we're, we're, I won't go

1595
01:26:28.868 --> 01:26:30.012
<v Deb Goodkin>into it, but I mean, right.

1596
01:26:30.012 --> 01:26:31.864
<v Deb Goodkin>I I mean, we change history and,

1597
01:26:32.766 --> 01:26:36.615
<v Deb Goodkin>um, and it's interesting.

1598
01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:39.106
<v Deb Goodkin>Um, I mean, it's an interesting

1599
01:26:39.166 --> 01:26:42.841
<v Deb Goodkin>question because when I give my
talks on FreeBSD, I do go over the

1600
01:26:42.901 --> 01:26:45.230
<v Deb Goodkin>history because I think that's
really important.

1601
01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.813
<v Deb Goodkin>But you can look at it as like,
well, that's before who cares

1602
01:26:49.853 --> 01:26:51.143
<v Deb Goodkin>about that?
You know, we want to know what,

1603
01:26:51.163 --> 01:26:53.901
<v Deb Goodkin>you know, what's important now or
why it's so great now.

1604
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:58.272
<v Deb Goodkin>But to me, it always goes back to
the foundation of anything.

1605
01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:01.491
<v Deb Goodkin>So, you know, it can be
multiplication.

1606
01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:05.209
<v Deb Goodkin>So understanding instead of
memorizing tables, understanding

1607
01:27:05.269 --> 01:27:06.071
<v Deb Goodkin>that, you know, yeah.

1608
01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:10.028
<v Deb Goodkin>So it's very Montessori, you know,

1609
01:27:10.068 --> 01:27:12.625
<v Deb Goodkin>if you actually touch it and add
it, you could see it and feel it.

1610
01:27:13.563 --> 01:27:16.212
<v Deb Goodkin>That's foundation and everything
builds off of that.

1611
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.030
<v Deb Goodkin>And so understanding the history,
what really happened and why, and,

1612
01:27:20.050 --> 01:27:22.928
<v Deb Goodkin>you know, and the reasons can can
be different for different people.

1613
01:27:23.021 --> 01:27:23.202
<v Deb Goodkin>Right.

1614
01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.207
<v Deb Goodkin>And so, um, so having the stories

1615
01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:29.294
<v Deb Goodkin>available for others, uh, is just
really important.

1616
01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.752
<v Deb Goodkin>And yeah, hopefully people find it
interesting.

1617
01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.311
<v Deb Goodkin>And I know that my story it's, you
know, at the time I never really

1618
01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:39.548
<v Deb Goodkin>thought like, oh, you know,
there's two women in all my

1619
01:27:39.609 --> 01:27:40.632
<v Deb Goodkin>engineering classes.

1620
01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:42.650
<v Deb Goodkin>Like I'm at the forefront of this.

1621
01:27:43.001 --> 01:27:44.589
<v Deb Goodkin>I never thought of that.

1622
01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.285
<v Deb Goodkin>I thought, oh, here's a skill I

1623
01:27:47.305 --> 01:27:53.162
<v Deb Goodkin>can get and I can have job and
financial security and a good

1624
01:27:53.243 --> 01:27:53.686
<v Deb Goodkin>future.

1625
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.628
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I really looked at it like

1626
01:27:55.689 --> 01:27:55.930
<v Deb Goodkin>that.

1627
01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:58.065
<v Deb Goodkin>And it was an opportunity and I

1628
01:27:58.426 --> 01:28:03.081
<v Deb Goodkin>was able, I wasn't limited, like,
you know, when you think of people

1629
01:28:03.121 --> 01:28:07.754
<v Deb Goodkin>like Maria Montessori who wanted,
she wanted to be an engineer and

1630
01:28:07.774 --> 01:28:08.122
<v Deb Goodkin>she could.

1631
01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.087
<v Deb Goodkin>They wouldn't allow women to be

1632
01:28:10.107 --> 01:28:10.389
<v Deb Goodkin>engineers.

1633
01:28:11.041 --> 01:28:12.448
<v Deb Goodkin>And I guess that was Italy.

1634
01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.694
<v Deb Goodkin>She became a medical doctor and
she was able to do that.

1635
01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:23.912
<v Deb Goodkin>And then what she did was amazing
with her, you know, way, her way

1636
01:28:23.952 --> 01:28:30.491
<v Deb Goodkin>of teaching and developing minds
is so amazing and how they tried

1637
01:28:30.531 --> 01:28:32.943
<v Deb Goodkin>to limit her and she still figured
out a way to do it.

1638
01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:37.231
<v Deb Goodkin>So actually probably because she
became a doctor was because of

1639
01:28:37.291 --> 01:28:41.411
<v Deb Goodkin>that, because she worked with
children and she learned how the

1640
01:28:41.451 --> 01:28:41.913
<v Deb Goodkin>brain worked.

1641
01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:44.588
<v Deb Goodkin>If she was an engineer, she

1642
01:28:44.648 --> 01:28:46.554
<v Deb Goodkin>probably would not have made that
contribution.

1643
01:28:48.487 --> 01:28:49.952
<v Deb Goodkin>And I had never thought of that
before.

1644
01:28:50.583 --> 01:28:51.487
<v Karen Herman>It's really interesting.

1645
01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:56.847
<v Karen Herman>Yeah, but I think, too, with

1646
01:28:56.867 --> 01:29:00.522
<v Karen Herman>things moving so quickly in the
field, it's good to take a moment

1647
01:29:00.622 --> 01:29:03.512
<v Karen Herman>and capture a moment in time as
well, you know.

1648
01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:04.122
<v Deb Goodkin>True.

1649
01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:05.507
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, yeah.

1650
01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:05.520
<v Karen Herman>Yeah.

1651
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:05.520
<v Karen Herman>Yeah.

1652
01:29:07.684 --> 01:29:08.949
<v Karen Herman>So one last question.

1653
01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.366
<v Karen Herman>And that is, if your great, great

1654
01:29:11.486 --> 01:29:15.326
<v Karen Herman>grandchild were to stumble on this
recording 100 years from now, what

1655
01:29:15.346 --> 01:29:17.969
<v Karen Herman>would you want them to know?
What would you want to say to

1656
01:29:18.009 --> 01:29:23.046
<v Karen Herman>them?
If they stumble on this recording,

1657
01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:29.360
<v Deb Goodkin>so they're watching this
recording, that I think I'd want

1658
01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:35.074
<v Deb Goodkin>them to know just that they can do
anything that they want.

1659
01:29:35.681 --> 01:29:37.930
<v Deb Goodkin>And it doesn't mean it's easy.

1660
01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:40.128
<v Deb Goodkin>And usually you have to work hard

1661
01:29:40.449 --> 01:29:40.871
<v Deb Goodkin>towards it.

1662
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.531
<v Deb Goodkin>But if you want it, then go for

1663
01:29:44.632 --> 01:29:44.692
<v Deb Goodkin>it.

1664
01:29:45.781 --> 01:29:49.390
<v Deb Goodkin>And don't let anyone stop you and

1665
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:50.813
<v Deb Goodkin>tell you you can't do it.

1666
01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:55.192
<v Deb Goodkin>And just believe in yourself.

1667
01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:59.792
<v Deb Goodkin>But also try to find people to
help you, too.

1668
01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:03.748
<v Deb Goodkin>And just try.

1669
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.646
<v Deb Goodkin>And the other thing, too, is just

1670
01:30:09.208 --> 01:30:10.873
<v Deb Goodkin>we learn from our failures.

1671
01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.027
<v Deb Goodkin>I mean, you always hear that.

1672
01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.307
<v Deb Goodkin>But it's really true.

1673
01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:16.529
<v Deb Goodkin>And if you don't try something,

1674
01:30:16.549 --> 01:30:17.493
<v Deb Goodkin>you won't fail.

1675
01:30:18.562 --> 01:30:22.291
<v Deb Goodkin>And so you lose out on that

1676
01:30:22.332 --> 01:30:23.494
<v Deb Goodkin>learning opportunity.

1677
01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:26.849
<v Deb Goodkin>So when you do fail, it's pretty

1678
01:30:26.909 --> 01:30:28.434
<v Deb Goodkin>horrible at the time.

1679
01:30:28.434 --> 01:30:30.406
<v Deb Goodkin>But you get past it.

1680
01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:38.269
<v Deb Goodkin>And once you get past it, you use
that knowledge to either do better

1681
01:30:38.269 --> 01:30:43.404
<v Deb Goodkin>and or be better or whatever it
is.

1682
01:30:43.404 --> 01:30:45.089
<v Deb Goodkin>So I think that's it.

1683
01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.570
<v Deb Goodkin>Just the fact that there's so many

1684
01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:49.713
<v Deb Goodkin>opportunities out there.

1685
01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.965
<v Deb Goodkin>And really, try to figure out what

1686
01:30:52.486 --> 01:30:56.255
<v Deb Goodkin>you enjoy and what's your passion.

1687
01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:58.586
<v Deb Goodkin>And try it.

1688
01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:04.950
<v Deb Goodkin>Because really, when you look at
your lifetime, it's a long time.

1689
01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.549
<v Deb Goodkin>And you can change.

1690
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.229
<v Deb Goodkin>So if you make a decision to do

1691
01:31:12.289 --> 01:31:12.751
<v Deb Goodkin>something.

1692
01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.348
<v Deb Goodkin>And maybe you realize maybe that's

1693
01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:18.974
<v Deb Goodkin>not what you want, that's OK.

1694
01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:21.849
<v Deb Goodkin>That you have time to try

1695
01:31:21.889 --> 01:31:22.591
<v Deb Goodkin>something else.

1696
01:31:23.281 --> 01:31:26.346
<v Deb Goodkin>And what you bring with you is you

1697
01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:31.216
<v Deb Goodkin>gain that experience and
knowledge, too.

1698
01:31:31.602 --> 01:31:33.931
<v Deb Goodkin>So that's what I would say.

1699
01:31:35.104 --> 01:31:36.750
<v Deb Goodkin>And hopefully, I will have great

1700
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:37.412
<v Deb Goodkin>grandchildren.

1701
01:31:40.730 --> 01:31:41.713
<v Karen Herman>That's a great answer.

1702
01:31:41.713 --> 01:31:45.230
<v Karen Herman>So So is there anything you wanted
to say that maybe we've skipped

1703
01:31:45.330 --> 01:31:48.850
<v Karen Herman>over that you feel is important
that you'd like to get on the

1704
01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:51.791
<v Karen Herman>record?
It's funny.

1705
01:31:51.860 --> 01:32:01.534
<v Deb Goodkin>Because to me, when I look back in
my career, I don't see anything

1706
01:32:01.615 --> 01:32:04.027
<v Deb Goodkin>significant that I feel like I
accomplished.

1707
01:32:04.881 --> 01:32:11.515
<v Deb Goodkin>But I also looked at when I was
very career driven when I started

1708
01:32:11.675 --> 01:32:11.776
<v Deb Goodkin>out.

1709
01:32:12.862 --> 01:32:14.726
<v Deb Goodkin>And when I decided to have

1710
01:32:14.787 --> 01:32:18.375
<v Deb Goodkin>children, it really changed my
perspective.

1711
01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.490
<v Deb Goodkin>And I think that happens to most
people.

1712
01:32:21.423 --> 01:32:24.292
<v Deb Goodkin>And you realize what's important.

1713
01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:29.409
<v Deb Goodkin>And I think defining that or

1714
01:32:29.449 --> 01:32:32.855
<v Deb Goodkin>understanding that is what should
drive you.

1715
01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.184
<v Deb Goodkin>And then you work around it.

1716
01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:38.644
<v Deb Goodkin>And if you're still really, I

1717
01:32:39.325 --> 01:32:43.735
<v Deb Goodkin>mean, I've always wanted to
continue working and working hard

1718
01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:47.112
<v Deb Goodkin>and working in an area that I was
interested in.

1719
01:32:47.701 --> 01:32:51.090
<v Deb Goodkin>But also realizing, too, that
there's other things that are also

1720
01:32:51.491 --> 01:32:52.554
<v Deb Goodkin>as or more important.

1721
01:32:53.502 --> 01:32:57.231
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I feel really good about

1722
01:32:58.073 --> 01:32:58.815
<v Deb Goodkin>what I've done.

1723
01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.949
<v Deb Goodkin>And this isn't the end of my life.

1724
01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:07.614
<v Deb Goodkin>And so I see so much more that I
could do, which is exciting, I

1725
01:33:07.675 --> 01:33:07.895
<v Deb Goodkin>think.

1726
01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:11.949
<v Deb Goodkin>I still have ideas going around my

1727
01:33:11.989 --> 01:33:13.874
<v Deb Goodkin>head of things that I would like
to do.

1728
01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:20.714
<v Deb Goodkin>And I'm happy that I'm healthy and
that I feel like I'll be able to

1729
01:33:20.734 --> 01:33:21.095
<v Deb Goodkin>do them.

1730
01:33:23.566 --> 01:33:25.310
<v Deb Goodkin>And I really appreciate the time

1731
01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:26.012
<v Deb Goodkin>that you gave me.

1732
01:33:26.821 --> 01:33:28.608
<v Deb Goodkin>And I look forward to hearing

1733
01:33:28.648 --> 01:33:29.411
<v Deb Goodkin>other stories.

1734
01:33:30.222 --> 01:33:31.445
<v Deb Goodkin>And that's what's exciting, too,

1735
01:33:31.485 --> 01:33:36.986
<v Deb Goodkin>about this project is going back,
is being able to watch some of

1736
01:33:37.006 --> 01:33:39.053
<v Deb Goodkin>these other stories and learning
from these people, too.

1737
01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:43.433
<v Karen Herman>Well, thank you so, so much for
sharing your story with us.

1738
01:33:43.433 --> 01:33:45.348
<v Deb Goodkin>Oh, you're welcome.

1739
01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.348
<v Deb Goodkin>It has been really fun spending

1740
01:33:48.368 --> 01:33:49.452
<v Deb Goodkin>time just thinking back.

1741
01:33:49.452 --> 01:33:51.730
<v Deb Goodkin>I'm I'm like, what did I do?

1742
01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:53.971
<v Deb Goodkin>Why did I even choose going to
TAC?

1743
01:33:53.971 --> 01:33:59.591
<v Deb Goodkin>Because it was so long ago, right?
It certainly seemed like the right

1744
01:33:59.631 --> 01:33:59.852
<v Karen Herman>move.

1745
01:34:00.202 --> 01:34:01.188
<v Deb Goodkin>What's that?

1746
01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:04.852
<v Karen Herman>I said, it certainly seemed like
the right move, though.

1747
01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:06.267
<v Karen Herman>When you really look back.

1748
01:34:06.721 --> 01:34:07.506
<v Deb Goodkin>Yeah, yeah.

1749
01:34:08.223 --> 01:34:10.272
<v Deb Goodkin>I never regret not taking this
path.

1750
01:34:11.705 --> 01:34:13.692
<v Deb Goodkin>So and I think that's important,
too.
