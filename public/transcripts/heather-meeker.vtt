00:00:02.784 --> 00:00:08.193
<v Zack>Hi, I'm Zack Ellis interviewing
Heather Meeker for FOSSDA, the

2
00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:11.145
<v Zack>Free and Open Source Stories
Digital Archive.

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.070
<v Zack>So Heather, I want to start off by
asking you to tell me a little bit

4
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.531
<v Zack>about yourself.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.386
<v Heather>Well, I am a lawyer and a venture

6
00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:27.514
<v Heather>capitalist, and both in the area
of open source software.

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.333
<v Heather>And I've been practicing law for
nearly 30 years, mostly in this

8
00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:35.714
<v Heather>area.

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.024
<v Heather>And then I've been doing VC work

10
00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:40.130
<v Heather>for about three years in this
area.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Heather>I have a checkered past beyond
that, but maybe not all that

12
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.934
<v Heather>relevant to what we're doing.

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.485
<v Heather>I've done a lot of stuff in life.

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.388
<v Heather>Law was my third career and my
best one.

15
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.051
<v Heather>So, but that's what I'm doing
these days.

16
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:00.484
<v Zack>Fantastic.

17
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.425
<v Zack>So law and venture capital, so

18
00:01:03.486 --> 00:01:08.163
<v Zack>you've seen different sides of the
open source world, it sounds like.

19
00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:09.948
<v Heather>Yeah, definitely.

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.107
<v Heather>And, you know, one of the reasons

21
00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:18.322
<v Heather>that I got to that dual role is
that a lot of what I was doing as

22
00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:22.133
<v Heather>a lawyer ended up being more like
business counseling.

23
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.811
<v Heather>So that is actually a more natural
evolution than you might think.

24
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.389
<v Heather>So these days, it's a little hard
to separate the two, except for

25
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.465
<v Heather>you get paid differently for doing
the two things.

26
00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:42.113
<v Zack>So how did that get started for
you?

27
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.772
<v Zack>And it sounds like, were you, walk
me through a little bit, maybe of

28
00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:49.605
<v Zack>the high level, like the
beginnings of your career into

29
00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:53.642
<v Zack>when you started to get involved
in software, in open source?

30
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.330
<v Heather>Well, so I actually was a computer
programmer in the 1980s.

31
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.628
<v Heather>I know that just sounds absolutely
ancient now.

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.127
<v Heather>Doesn't sound ancient to me, but
it's all a matter of perspective.

33
00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.651
<v Heather>And I got into that because there
was a lot of demand for people to

34
00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:18.946
<v Heather>work in particularly applications
programming.

35
00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:25.172
<v Heather>When I graduated from college, and
I didn't have a degree in computer

36
00:02:25.192 --> 00:02:28.727
<v Heather>science, and in fact, most people
didn't have degrees in computer

37
00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:32.664
<v Heather>science, you couldn't really get a
degree in computer science, except

38
00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:35.432
<v Heather>for maybe, you know, some schools.

39
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.344
<v Heather>I went to a liberal arts college,

40
00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:41.461
<v Heather>and I think they had a computer
science major, but you had to kind

41
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:42.566
<v Heather>of cobble it together.

42
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.244
<v Heather>So I had actually learned

43
00:02:45.344 --> 00:02:50.602
<v Heather>programming as a kid, because my
father taught me the basics of it.

44
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.850
<v Heather>And then when I was in college, I
took some computer science

45
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.565
<v Heather>classes, basically, because the
computer science lab was air

46
00:02:59.605 --> 00:03:00.147
<v Heather>conditioned.

47
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.287
<v Heather>And I went to summer school, and

48
00:03:03.307 --> 00:03:04.250
<v Heather>it was really hot.

49
00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:06.584
<v Heather>Plus, I was interested in

50
00:03:07.626 --> 00:03:09.832
<v Heather>programming, you know, I thought
it was kind of cool.

51
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.793
<v Heather>So I graduated, and I quickly like
moved into computer programming,

52
00:03:17.853 --> 00:03:20.949
<v Heather>because there was a lot of
opportunity in that area.

53
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.592
<v Heather>And nobody required a degree in it
at that time, maybe because there

54
00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:26.661
<v Heather>just weren't enough people.

55
00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:28.587
<v Heather>So you could basically go and put

56
00:03:28.627 --> 00:03:30.132
<v Heather>your hand up and say, I'm
interested.

57
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.229
<v Heather>And if you had a college degree,
or at least had been to college

58
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.666
<v Heather>for some amount of time, that was
a real plus, right.

59
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.450
<v Heather>So I worked as a programmer for
about four years.

60
00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:45.892
<v Heather>And then I went off and did some
other stuff.

61
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Heather>I was a professional musician for
a while, opened a business.

62
00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:59.173
<v Heather>And then after I went to law
school, I realized that actually

63
00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:03.186
<v Heather>the law around computer software
was very interesting to me because

64
00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:04.230
<v Heather>I had this background.

65
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.804
<v Heather>So that's a long way of saying

66
00:04:07.245 --> 00:04:10.954
<v Heather>that when I started practicing
law, I immediately started

67
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.754
<v Heather>focusing on computer software
licensing as a practice.

68
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.231
<v Heather>And then very soon after that,
people started to become aware of

69
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:23.652
<v Heather>open source.

70
00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:26.265
<v Heather>And they started asking me

71
00:04:26.306 --> 00:04:27.230
<v Heather>questions about it.

72
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.606
<v Heather>So, you know, I had to figure out

73
00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:32.901
<v Heather>the answers to the questions
because there weren't many answers

74
00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:34.668
<v Heather>floating around there at that
time.

75
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.470
<v Heather>So I just, you know, started to
try to figure out what the answers

76
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:39.831
<v Heather>were.

77
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.087
<v Heather>And when you're in an organization

78
00:04:44.128 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Heather>and you know 10% more than the
person in the next room, you're

79
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:50.451
<v Heather>the expert, you know, that's just
the way the world works.

80
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.468
<v Heather>And so people kept asking me
questions and I kept trying to

81
00:04:53.568 --> 00:04:55.945
<v Heather>answer them and building up my
knowledge.

82
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.527
<v Heather>And that's how I got into it.

83
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.268
<v Heather>I would say that the reason I put

84
00:05:03.308 --> 00:05:06.595
<v Heather>that effort in was that I just
thought it was really interesting.

85
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.830
<v Heather>I mean, it was something that I
had never seen before.

86
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.729
<v Heather>And there's really not been a lot
like it in the law because it's

87
00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:20.466
<v Heather>just kind of a grassroots movement
and from a legal point of view, it

88
00:05:20.527 --> 00:05:25.923
<v Heather>was very like messy and hard to
understand, which I think most

89
00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:28.249
<v Heather>lawyers love stuff like that,
right?

90
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.424
<v Heather>We're puzzle solvers.

91
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.903
<v Heather>And this was a really interesting

92
00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:39.662
<v Heather>puzzle that moreover had something
to do with a topic that I was

93
00:05:39.743 --> 00:05:40.426
<v Heather>interested in.

94
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.168
<v Heather>So that's how I got involved in it

95
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.492
<v Heather>as a lawyer.

96
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.163
<v Heather>And then after practicing for many

97
00:05:46.223 --> 00:05:53.563
<v Heather>years, I got more interested in
how to make business models work

98
00:05:53.624 --> 00:05:54.307
<v Heather>in this area.

99
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.444
<v Heather>And that's how I got into the

100
00:05:56.604 --> 00:05:57.367
<v Heather>venture capital.

101
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.045
<v Zack>So it was kind of initially an

102
00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:07.441
<v Zack>interest in computer science or
programming, but that kind of came

103
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:11.392
<v Zack>from your dad introducing you to
computers at a really early age.

104
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.522
<v Zack>It did.

105
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.747
<v Zack>Well, just out of curiosity, what

106
00:06:15.928 --> 00:06:18.206
<v Zack>did he do?
And how did that come about where

107
00:06:18.226 --> 00:06:19.912
<v Zack>he was like, oh, yeah, he's going
to love this.

108
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.048
<v Zack>He was actually a programmer.

109
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.305
<v Heather>And that doesn't sound

110
00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:29.640
<v Heather>extraordinary today at all, but it
was incredibly extraordinary then.

111
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.694
<v Heather>I mean, he actually worked in a
think tank kind of place and they

112
00:06:35.754 --> 00:06:39.728
<v Heather>were starting to use computers to
solve problems, which, you know,

113
00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Heather>people just hadn't even done
before that.

114
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:48.353
<v Heather>And so he used to take me to work
and I would see the computers with

115
00:06:48.373 --> 00:06:50.066
<v Heather>the big tape drives on them.

116
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.425
<v Heather>And it's like a lot of really

117
00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Heather>amusing stuff about going to these
places and being exposed to that.

118
00:06:57.581 --> 00:07:02.652
<v Heather>But when I was a kid and people
would ask me what my father did

119
00:07:02.752 --> 00:07:08.027
<v Heather>for a living, you know, I started
saying he was like a spy, right,

120
00:07:08.068 --> 00:07:13.585
<v Heather>because it was easier to explain
than telling people that he was a

121
00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:17.234
<v Heather>computer data processor, which is
what he told me to say.

122
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.921
<v Heather>Right.

123
00:07:18.443 --> 00:07:19.989
<v Heather>No one understood what that was.

124
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.570
<v Heather>And and so I got a really early
view into that.

125
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.748
<v Heather>And of course, he did not have a
technical education either,

126
00:07:29.768 --> 00:07:34.349
<v Heather>though, because at that time,
nobody did basically.

127
00:07:35.425 --> 00:07:35.726
<v Zack>Yeah.

128
00:07:36.128 --> 00:07:36.349
<v Zack>Yeah.

129
00:07:37.062 --> 00:07:39.610
<v Zack>So then so then you started
studying programming.

130
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.194
<v Zack>What like what what kept you
interested in computer science?

131
00:07:47.243 --> 00:07:49.210
<v Heather>Computer like programming is.

132
00:07:52.463 --> 00:07:55.588
<v Heather>It's an experience like almost

133
00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:00.700
<v Heather>nothing else, like when you are
writing a program, you are in

134
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:07.673
<v Heather>total control, right, subject to
the rules of the language and the

135
00:08:08.074 --> 00:08:12.312
<v Heather>environment you're in, you tell
the computer exactly what to do.

136
00:08:12.961 --> 00:08:16.893
<v Heather>If the computer doesn't do what
you ask it to do, it's your fault.

137
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:17.662
<v Heather>Right.

138
00:08:17.722 --> 00:08:20.352
<v Heather>I mean, that's not always true.

139
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.768
<v Heather>It's almost always true.

140
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.592
<v Heather>So that's like this experience.

141
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.712
<v Heather>It's like pure engineering in a
way.

142
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.450
<v Heather>Like you're not even you're not
even really bounded by the

143
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.495
<v Heather>physical world in programming.

144
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.505
<v Heather>Like it's like being a little

145
00:08:37.645 --> 00:08:41.701
<v Heather>megalomaniac, you know, it's like
really exciting for that reason.

146
00:08:42.182 --> 00:08:45.273
<v Heather>Also, it's one of the most
absorbing things I've ever done.

147
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.212
<v Heather>Like when I was a coder, I would
go to work and I'd get there, you

148
00:08:52.134 --> 00:08:56.270
<v Heather>know, at eight in the morning and
then at five I would look up and

149
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.193
<v Heather>the day would be over.

150
00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.325
<v Heather>And it was almost as if no time

151
00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:03.214
<v Heather>had passed because I was so
focused on what I was doing.

152
00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:07.971
<v Heather>And I don't think I've ever
experienced anything else quite

153
00:09:08.453 --> 00:09:09.014
<v Heather>like that.

154
00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:11.284
<v Heather>Nothing else I've ever done in my

155
00:09:11.364 --> 00:09:17.761
<v Heather>life, either for money or for fun,
has has absorbed me that much.

156
00:09:18.303 --> 00:09:22.393
<v Heather>And I really loved it for that
reason, but also got kind of burnt

157
00:09:22.593 --> 00:09:23.983
<v Heather>out on it for that reason.

158
00:09:24.003 --> 00:09:26.332
<v Heather>And and I stopped doing it.

159
00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:31.913
<v Heather>Not sure whether that was a good
idea or a bad idea, but but it was

160
00:09:31.953 --> 00:09:32.941
<v Heather>what happened, you know.

161
00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:34.990
<v Heather>So that's what I loved about it.

162
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.691
<v Heather>It was just you got to solve
puzzles however you you know, and

163
00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:44.192
<v Heather>you were only really bounded by
your ingenuity in doing that.

164
00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:50.153
<v Heather>I also thought coding was a very
creative activity, and I'm not

165
00:09:50.193 --> 00:09:51.681
<v Heather>sure everybody thinks that.

166
00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:54.549
<v Heather>But but you have like so much

167
00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:56.294
<v Heather>control over how you do things.

168
00:09:57.244 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Heather>I just found that fascinating.

169
00:10:00.002 --> 00:10:04.551
<v Zack>And then so that kind of that that
that sort of freedom and

170
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:08.648
<v Zack>creativity kind of and just
natural draw to it kind of kept

171
00:10:08.668 --> 00:10:08.889
<v Zack>you there.

172
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.524
<v Zack>But then you then you left and

173
00:10:10.604 --> 00:10:15.080
<v Zack>went into law kind of but for
programming and computer science.

174
00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:19.411
<v Zack>Tell me a little bit about kind of
the departure from programming and

175
00:10:19.432 --> 00:10:22.990
<v Zack>then into law and kind of what
attracted you to to law.

176
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.771
<v Zack>And then we'll marry those
together with open source.

177
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.927
<v Zack>But tell me a little bit.

178
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.829
<v Zack>Well, there was another step in

179
00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:29.110
<v Zack>there.

180
00:10:30.003 --> 00:10:32.492
<v Heather>I I went to music school.

181
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.894
<v Heather>I went to a basically a trade
school is a one year program.

182
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:43.292
<v Heather>And I went to learn to play drums
because I had been, you know,

183
00:10:43.733 --> 00:10:44.615
<v Heather>learning drums.

184
00:10:45.663 --> 00:10:47.329
<v Heather>And I had gotten the idea that I

185
00:10:47.369 --> 00:10:48.513
<v Heather>wanted to be a musician.

186
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.088
<v Heather>By the way, that's a bad idea.

187
00:10:52.265 --> 00:10:56.717
<v Heather>But not because it's really fun to
play music, but it's a terrible

188
00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:56.997
<v Heather>career.

189
00:10:56.997 --> 00:10:57.853
<v Heather>Anyway, a terrible career.

190
00:10:57.853 --> 00:11:05.957
<v Heather>Anyway, so I went to this school
and and and then I started working

191
00:11:06.237 --> 00:11:07.205
<v Heather>professionally as a musician and I
I opened a rehearsal studio.

192
00:11:07.205 --> 00:11:07.305
<v Heather>working professionally as a
musician and I I opened a

193
00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:07.325
<v Heather>rehearsal studio.

194
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.026
<v Heather>So I had this little business.

195
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.756
<v Heather>And and and then I just realized,
well, this is an awful career.

196
00:11:17.756 --> 00:11:21.211
<v Heather>You know, You know, there is
really no future in this because

197
00:11:21.231 --> 00:11:23.102
<v Heather>you know how they say in the
entertainment industry, industry,

198
00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.349
<v Heather>it's who, you know, that's not
just like Sour Graves.

199
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.009
<v Heather>It's really who, you know, and I
didn't know anybody.

200
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:29.922
<v Heather>Right.

201
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.704
<v Heather>And I suppose there are some

202
00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:34.351
<v Heather>people who are like super
brilliant, who can just make it

203
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.883
<v Heather>without any connections.

204
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.347
<v Heather>I was not one of those people.

205
00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:40.105
<v Heather>I mean, I was competent, but not
great.

206
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.207
<v Heather>By the way, I in music school, I I
met people who were really

207
00:11:44.247 --> 00:11:44.668
<v Heather>brilliant.

208
00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:47.403
<v Heather>And I and I realized I'm not one

209
00:11:47.523 --> 00:11:48.587
<v Heather>of those people.

210
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.086
<v Heather>Like I am not a super talented

211
00:11:52.848 --> 00:11:53.049
<v Heather>musician.

212
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.222
<v Heather>Right.

213
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.344
<v Heather>And that's OK.

214
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:56.982
<v Heather>I still enjoy doing it.

215
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Heather>But but they understood that about
myself.

216
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.907
<v Heather>You know, I I could do it OK.

217
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.146
<v Heather>But I would never be like this

218
00:12:05.166 --> 00:12:06.030
<v Heather>great player.

219
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.383
<v Heather>So so I decide, OK, I'm not going

220
00:12:07.403 --> 00:12:08.205
<v Heather>to do that anymore.

221
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.205
<v Heather>Plus, I was about nearly 30 at

222
00:12:12.245 --> 00:12:12.747
<v Heather>that time.

223
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.883
<v Heather>And it's kind of a a young kid's

224
00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:15.344
<v Heather>profession.

225
00:12:19.101 --> 00:12:26.372
<v Heather>And and so what I did was I got a

226
00:12:26.472 --> 00:12:30.959
<v Heather>job as a as a temp secretary at a
at a record label.

227
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:31.069
<v Heather>I knew someone who worked at a at
a record label.

228
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:34.575
<v Heather>I knew someone who worked at the
record label, and they were and I

229
00:12:34.595 --> 00:12:35.203
<v Heather>really needed a job because I
didn't have any money.

230
00:12:35.203 --> 00:12:35.333
<v Heather>were and I really needed a job
because I didn't have any money.

231
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.235
<v Heather>I didn't have any health
insurance.

232
00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:40.399
<v Zack>It was And and insurance.

233
00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:40.651
<v Zack>It was awful.

234
00:12:40.651 --> 00:12:41.062
<v Zack>And and so I started was awful.

235
00:12:41.062 --> 00:12:41.423
<v Zack>And and so I started working there

236
00:12:41.503 --> 00:12:47.621
<v Zack>and they put me in the legal
department and actually really

237
00:12:47.721 --> 00:12:49.708
<v Heather>enjoyed working in the legal
department.

238
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.591
<v Heather>So then they made me a paralegal
and then they made me a lawyer.

239
00:12:57.462 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Heather>Then they made me a paralegal.

240
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.050
<v Heather>One One of the paralegals left.

241
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.468
<v Heather>They made me a paralegal.

242
00:13:03.402 --> 00:13:06.828
<v Heather>And then and then I I looked

243
00:13:06.868 --> 00:13:11.001
<v Heather>around and I thought I could make
a lot more money doing the same

244
00:13:11.061 --> 00:13:13.471
<v Heather>work if I just went to law school.

245
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.427
<v Heather>Now, that's a huge commitment of

246
00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:16.291
<v Heather>time and money.

247
00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:22.773
<v Heather>And and so that's that's what got

248
00:13:22.813 --> 00:13:23.875
<v Heather>me interested in law.

249
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.986
<v Heather>Actually, you know, I was doing

250
00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:28.433
<v Heather>some work in that area and I
thought it was really interesting.

251
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.969
<v Heather>And by the way, I thought that I
would become an entertainment

252
00:13:32.009 --> 00:13:35.329
<v Heather>lawyer because I had been working
at an entertainment business.

253
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.268
<v Heather>But when I got to law school and I
realized you could work in

254
00:13:39.348 --> 00:13:43.984
<v Heather>technology and and that actually
there was a big crossover to

255
00:13:44.064 --> 00:13:48.155
<v Heather>entertainment, I thought I found
the perfect place for me.

256
00:13:49.422 --> 00:13:55.092
<v Heather>I graduated law school in 1994 and
basically the World Wide Web

257
00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:58.765
<v Heather>happened for most people in about
95 or 96.

258
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.970
<v Heather>And so there was something going
on that they called convergence,

259
00:14:04.111 --> 00:14:07.027
<v Heather>meaning technology and media
coming together.

260
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:08.426
<v Heather>And that was just me.

261
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.668
<v Heather>I was right at the intersection of

262
00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:11.371
<v Heather>those things.

263
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.004
<v Heather>And when I found out you could

264
00:14:13.124 --> 00:14:17.903
<v Heather>work in that area, I thought I
will never, never wanted to do

265
00:14:17.963 --> 00:14:18.467
<v Heather>anything else.

266
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.049
<v Heather>This this was perfect for me.

267
00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:28.092
<v Zack>Well, so I'm curious what you
talked about, like being really

268
00:14:28.393 --> 00:14:33.105
<v Zack>consumed by programming early on
and then all of a sudden,

269
00:14:33.947 --> 00:14:37.055
<v Zack>seemingly by surprise, loving
legal.

270
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.065
<v Zack>What was it about legal?
And I'm curious if you saw any

271
00:14:41.105 --> 00:14:44.941
<v Zack>similarities or differences
between the joy that you got from

272
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:46.710
<v Zack>the legal work and from
programming.

273
00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:53.714
<v Heather>Well, you know, there were some
similarities in in the in the joy

274
00:14:53.774 --> 00:14:54.375
<v Heather>I got from it.

275
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.424
<v Heather>There are also a huge number of

276
00:14:56.464 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Heather>similarities between programming
and legal, like, for instance, if

277
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.793
<v Heather>you're a if you're a transactional
lawyer like I was, I was doing

278
00:15:05.873 --> 00:15:06.334
<v Heather>deals.

279
00:15:08.266 --> 00:15:09.529
<v Heather>When you write contracts, you're

280
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.974
<v Heather>writing rules for people.

281
00:15:11.582 --> 00:15:12.604
<v Heather>When you're programming, you're

282
00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:15.693
<v Heather>writing rules for computers to
execute.

283
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.111
<v Heather>There are a huge number of
parallels between the two.

284
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.891
<v Heather>So I don't know, maybe I just like
writing rules.

285
00:15:22.882 --> 00:15:26.293
<v Heather>But but the kind of enjoyment I
got was pretty different.

286
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.992
<v Heather>Like it's it's they're both
intellectual tasks, but they're

287
00:15:33.012 --> 00:15:34.875
<v Heather>very different intellectual tasks.

288
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.023
<v Heather>Like computer programming is like

289
00:15:37.164 --> 00:15:42.635
<v Heather>pure problem solving and legal
work is all more analysis.

290
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.732
<v Heather>And and you have to deal with a
lot more vagueness.

291
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.490
<v Heather>Like computer programming pretty
much is what it is.

292
00:15:50.823 --> 00:15:53.733
<v Heather>And you can't as a programmer, you
usually can't change that.

293
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.031
<v Heather>Like you're in an environment and
there's well, you know, for people

294
00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:01.467
<v Heather>like me who are applications
programmers, you just given the

295
00:16:01.507 --> 00:16:05.269
<v Heather>environment, you deal with the
rules you're given for for law.

296
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.631
<v Heather>The rules are fuzzy, which is why
the world has so many lawyers, you

297
00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:14.070
<v Heather>know, so it's a different kind of
task and much, much more human

298
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:14.732
<v Heather>oriented.

299
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.425
<v Heather>I mean, programmers just sit there

300
00:16:17.466 --> 00:16:21.664
<v Heather>all day in front of a machine and
you don't have to interact with

301
00:16:21.764 --> 00:16:22.609
<v Heather>any human being.

302
00:16:23.662 --> 00:16:25.828
<v Heather>Lawyers have to, you know, that's

303
00:16:25.908 --> 00:16:29.206
<v Heather>actually about client service and
you have to interact with people.

304
00:16:31.684 --> 00:16:36.032
<v Zack>I'm curious when you first started
to get into law and saw this

305
00:16:36.072 --> 00:16:42.854
<v Zack>convergence of tech and law and
entertainment on top of that.

306
00:16:44.743 --> 00:16:48.952
<v Zack>Who are some of the early
influential figures in your career

307
00:16:49.673 --> 00:16:55.089
<v Zack>at that stage?
It's kind of hard to say because I

308
00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:57.254
<v Heather>was mostly blazing my own path.

309
00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:02.146
<v Heather>I mean, I had colleagues who

310
00:17:02.426 --> 00:17:09.497
<v Heather>taught me a lot, but that was more
about how to practice law.

311
00:17:09.497 --> 00:17:15.592
<v Heather>Law Law is a weird profession in
that you go to professional

312
00:17:15.692 --> 00:17:20.269
<v Heather>school, which is three years long,
and they teach you nothing about

313
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.051
<v Heather>practicing law.

314
00:17:22.763 --> 00:17:24.327
<v Heather>They teach you some stuff about

315
00:17:24.448 --> 00:17:27.114
<v Heather>law, but not about being a lawyer
at all.

316
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.190
<v Heather>They're basically teaching you to
be a judge.

317
00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:33.851
<v Heather>So most of us don't become judges
and we go into private practice

318
00:17:34.332 --> 00:17:36.928
<v Heather>and then you have to learn how to
be a lawyer.

319
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.072
<v Heather>So I had wonderful colleagues who
taught me how to be a lawyer.

320
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:49.494
<v Heather>But as far as the open source
expertise, you know, we were kind

321
00:17:49.554 --> 00:17:54.129
<v Heather>of writing the rules in a way like
we were looking at these licenses

322
00:17:54.189 --> 00:17:57.225
<v Heather>and trying to figure out how to
like plug them into a legal

323
00:17:57.306 --> 00:17:57.768
<v Heather>context.

324
00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.744
<v Heather>And one of the reasons I enjoyed

325
00:17:59.785 --> 00:18:03.081
<v Heather>the area is there just wasn't
anything out there about it.

326
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.071
<v Heather>So one of the things I started
doing was writing about it because

327
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:08.274
<v Heather>I really like to write.

328
00:18:09.183 --> 00:18:11.751
<v Heather>And I thought, OK, there are no

329
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:12.253
<v Heather>materials.

330
00:18:12.253 --> 00:18:13.126
<v Heather>I'll I'll just write them.

331
00:18:15.406 --> 00:18:18.514
<v Heather>And so I was kind of on my own for
a lot of it.

332
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:25.193
<v Heather>I mean, I've had some friends, you
know, whom I've been able to

333
00:18:25.253 --> 00:18:29.287
<v Heather>bounce things off of, but I wasn't
like I don't know, there wasn't

334
00:18:29.387 --> 00:18:31.714
<v Heather>one person who was like guiding me
at all.

335
00:18:32.926 --> 00:18:34.031
<v Zack>Yeah, yeah.

336
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.346
<v Zack>Like you said, it was kind of

337
00:18:36.426 --> 00:18:39.114
<v Zack>blazing your own path and it was
new.

338
00:18:39.114 --> 00:18:42.892
<v Zack>And And like you were kind of
people would clients would ask you

339
00:18:42.932 --> 00:18:43.333
<v Zack>questions.

340
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.650
<v Zack>You'd have to figure it out.

341
00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.552
<v Heather>Yeah, there were there weren't
answers, really.

342
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.051
<v Heather>You had to just kind of
extrapolate from the basic legal

343
00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:54.154
<v Heather>answers that you knew.

344
00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.110
<v Heather>And that was it was scary and

345
00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:57.853
<v Heather>challenging.

346
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.689
<v Heather>And but that's kind of what I

347
00:19:00.749 --> 00:19:01.853
<v Heather>liked about it, too.

348
00:19:02.121 --> 00:19:02.262
<v Zack>Yeah.

349
00:19:03.182 --> 00:19:08.352
<v Zack>Can you remember like the the
first time that you remember

350
00:19:08.553 --> 00:19:12.306
<v Zack>hearing about open source and what
that was and that is something

351
00:19:12.466 --> 00:19:21.070
<v Zack>different than typical way?
I think a client sent me a copy of

352
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.542
<v Heather>one of the permissive licenses
like the BSD license, which is a

353
00:19:24.582 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Heather>very short license.

354
00:19:27.023 --> 00:19:28.568
<v Heather>It's like a couple of paragraphs,

355
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:29.692
<v Heather>two, three paragraphs.

356
00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:33.791
<v Heather>And and it didn't look like

357
00:19:33.891 --> 00:19:35.014
<v Heather>anything I'd ever seen.

358
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.150
<v Heather>And then they were asking, is this

359
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.368
<v Heather>OK to use?
And there was no one around me to

360
00:19:41.468 --> 00:19:42.432
<v Heather>answer that question.

361
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.245
<v Heather>So then I started reading

362
00:19:44.325 --> 00:19:46.473
<v Heather>everything I could about what was
out there.

363
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.791
<v Heather>And there was some stuff written
about it, but it was mostly what I

364
00:19:50.831 --> 00:19:52.074
<v Heather>would call advocacy.

365
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.563
<v Heather>So there were free software

366
00:19:53.684 --> 00:19:57.975
<v Heather>advocates who were saying, you
know, software should be open.

367
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.311
<v Heather>But that wasn't legal analysis.

368
00:20:01.781 --> 00:20:02.022
<v Heather>Right.

369
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:08.594
<v Heather>And so the the legal objective
legal analysis was not out there

370
00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:08.875
<v Heather>at all.

371
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.627
<v Heather>So that's what I had to start, you

372
00:20:11.647 --> 00:20:13.994
<v Heather>know, trying to figure out.

373
00:20:14.843 --> 00:20:16.149
<v Heather>And there were other people trying

374
00:20:16.189 --> 00:20:16.771
<v Heather>to figure it out, too.

375
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.767
<v Heather>But we weren't really working

376
00:20:18.827 --> 00:20:20.012
<v Heather>together at that point.

377
00:20:21.924 --> 00:20:23.608
<v Heather>So, yeah, I'm sure it was somebody

378
00:20:23.668 --> 00:20:26.715
<v Heather>sending me like the BSD license, a
client asking.

379
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.412
<v Heather>I don't remember what client it
was, but client sends me BSD

380
00:20:30.432 --> 00:20:30.773
<v Heather>license.

381
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.907
<v Heather>It says, hey, is this OK?

382
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.432
<v Heather>And I got to answer that question
is actually a very difficult

383
00:20:36.472 --> 00:20:37.394
<v Heather>question at the time.

384
00:20:38.064 --> 00:20:38.165
<v Zack>Hmm.

385
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:46.455
<v Zack>So what so what was I mean, what
was that like to start to see some

386
00:20:46.475 --> 00:20:50.127
<v Zack>of these other types of licenses
come up and you're going through

387
00:20:50.147 --> 00:20:52.754
<v Zack>trying to look at research that's
out there?

388
00:20:53.161 --> 00:20:55.651
<v Zack>And what were the what were the
challenging aspects?

389
00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.593
<v Zack>And how did that kind of evolve
into something that became more?

390
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.789
<v Zack>I don't know if formal is the
right word, but they're like there

391
00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:06.889
<v Zack>are now practices and standard
licenses around open source.

392
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.691
<v Zack>Like, how did that kind of evolve
over time?

393
00:21:12.524 --> 00:21:16.452
<v Heather>Well, I should probably explain
that when you're a lawyer and

394
00:21:16.492 --> 00:21:19.564
<v Heather>someone asks you a question,
they'll present you with some

395
00:21:19.684 --> 00:21:23.834
<v Heather>facts and then you either know
what the law is or you look it up,

396
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.489
<v Heather>like you do some research and you
maybe you read a case or you read

397
00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:29.033
<v Heather>a statute or something like that.

398
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.685
<v Heather>And then you apply one to the

399
00:21:30.746 --> 00:21:31.931
<v Heather>other and you give an answer.

400
00:21:32.623 --> 00:21:33.848
<v Heather>So in open source, that didn't

401
00:21:33.868 --> 00:21:34.390
<v Heather>work at all.

402
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.489
<v Heather>There there were there were like

403
00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:41.708
<v Heather>there's copyright law, but it
doesn't tell you how to interpret

404
00:21:41.769 --> 00:21:43.013
<v Heather>open source licenses.

405
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.925
<v Heather>There's contract law, but it

406
00:21:45.426 --> 00:21:47.192
<v Heather>doesn't tell you a lot about that
either.

407
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.772
<v Heather>So I was looking at this set of
facts like this license, and then

408
00:21:51.832 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Heather>I had to go, OK, what do I know
about the law that would ever

409
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.905
<v Heather>apply to this thing?
Because Because it's just a new

410
00:21:57.986 --> 00:21:58.268
<v Heather>thing.

411
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.107
<v Heather>And I there was there were no

412
00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:01.091
<v Heather>cases to read.

413
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.588
<v Heather>There were no statutes to read.

414
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.753
<v Heather>There was there weren't even any
like law review articles to read.

415
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:12.773
<v Heather>And and so, you know, I just kind
of had to reason from first

416
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:13.995
<v Heather>principles about it.

417
00:22:15.144 --> 00:22:17.332
<v Heather>And and lawyers.

418
00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:20.331
<v Heather>That scares lawyers a lot.

419
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.048
<v Heather>Like when they don't have rules,

420
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:24.913
<v Heather>they get freaked out.

421
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:25.926
<v Heather>They like rules.

422
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:26.282
<v Heather>Right.

423
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.049
<v Heather>So the experience was like walking

424
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.814
<v Heather>out on a wire, you know.

425
00:22:32.702 --> 00:22:33.945
<v Heather>And and by the way, there were

426
00:22:34.025 --> 00:22:37.554
<v Heather>some people at the time and
probably still some some people,

427
00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:42.571
<v Heather>some lawyers who just would not
deal with it at all because it was

428
00:22:42.712 --> 00:22:44.015
<v Heather>too weird and too new.

429
00:22:44.902 --> 00:22:47.350
<v Heather>And they felt that it was risky to

430
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.473
<v Heather>give advice about it.

431
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.869
<v Heather>But but my clients had questions.

432
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.090
<v Heather>You know, I couldn't just say, oh,
no, I don't know the answer to

433
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:54.331
<v Heather>that.

434
00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.409
<v Heather>Like, you have to figure it out.

435
00:22:57.245 --> 00:22:57.386
<v Zack>Hmm.

436
00:22:59.164 --> 00:23:01.772
<v Zack>And then so so what started to

437
00:23:01.812 --> 00:23:05.131
<v Zack>happen after that?
Like what happened next?

438
00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.291
<v Zack>I mean, after you started to write
about it, you started to get more

439
00:23:09.572 --> 00:23:10.554
<v Zack>started to see this more.

440
00:23:11.606 --> 00:23:12.069
<v Zack>What happened?

441
00:23:12.882 --> 00:23:15.891
<v Heather>Well, first of all, I started to
meet other people who are

442
00:23:15.951 --> 00:23:17.174
<v Heather>interested in the topic.

443
00:23:17.962 --> 00:23:20.788
<v Heather>And so now we're like in the late

444
00:23:20.808 --> 00:23:21.029
<v Heather>1990s, early 2000s.

445
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.106
<v Heather>And and so now I'm meeting a few

446
00:23:26.186 --> 00:23:29.615
<v Heather>other lawyers who seem to be
knowledgeable about it.

447
00:23:30.643 --> 00:23:34.754
<v Heather>And so, first of all, some
communities developed around that

448
00:23:35.382 --> 00:23:38.312
<v Heather>so that we could bounce things off
each other.

449
00:23:40.604 --> 00:23:45.434
<v Heather>And and then, you know, I started
getting some reputation for

450
00:23:46.035 --> 00:23:46.336
<v Heather>knowing.

451
00:23:47.583 --> 00:23:50.169
<v Heather>You know about this thing and

452
00:23:50.189 --> 00:23:53.102
<v Heather>people would just call me out of
the blue, you know, because they

453
00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:56.753
<v Heather>they were really at sea trying to
figure this stuff out.

454
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.650
<v Heather>And then and then what really
developed over the next 10 years

455
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:07.751
<v Heather>and continues to develop today is
best practices around dealing with

456
00:24:07.772 --> 00:24:13.253
<v Heather>the licenses, because there's
still not a lot of direct law on

457
00:24:13.313 --> 00:24:13.474
<v Heather>them.

458
00:24:14.142 --> 00:24:16.388
<v Heather>But there are practices that

459
00:24:16.448 --> 00:24:18.234
<v Heather>people agree are best practices.

460
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.666
<v Heather>So that's that's really what

461
00:24:20.706 --> 00:24:24.422
<v Heather>happened next was some development
of the law, but mostly a

462
00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:29.835
<v Heather>development of a way that people
generally did things in order to

463
00:24:30.604 --> 00:24:31.649
<v Heather>deal with the licenses.

464
00:24:34.004 --> 00:24:37.271
<v Zack>What what was it like when you

465
00:24:37.792 --> 00:24:41.348
<v Zack>started to meet some of those
other players in the open source

466
00:24:41.388 --> 00:24:43.147
<v Zack>space?
And tell me a little bit.

467
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.452
<v Zack>I know you've said to me before
that there's there's different

468
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.071
<v Zack>types of stakeholders in the open
source community.

469
00:24:49.982 --> 00:24:53.432
<v Zack>Tell me a little bit about like
the types of stakeholders and some

470
00:24:53.452 --> 00:24:56.828
<v Zack>of those early interactions you
had as you started to meet like

471
00:24:57.189 --> 00:24:58.954
<v Zack>the world of players, if you will.

472
00:24:59.702 --> 00:25:01.729
<v Heather>Well, I met clients who were

473
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:02.692
<v Heather>interested in it.

474
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.287
<v Heather>And so they were actually usually

475
00:25:06.367 --> 00:25:10.115
<v Heather>other lawyers who wanted to learn
about it.

476
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.312
<v Heather>So I was helping them learn as I
learned about it.

477
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.374
<v Heather>I I also had clients who were
engineers and they're developers.

478
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.911
<v Heather>So they're the people actually
creating the software.

479
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.609
<v Heather>They're the most important people,
by the way.

480
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.613
<v Heather>The lawyers are just, you know, on
along for the ride.

481
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:28.982
<v Heather>Right.

482
00:25:31.104 --> 00:25:32.848
<v Heather>So I met a lot of engineers who

483
00:25:32.908 --> 00:25:35.895
<v Heather>actually interested in writing
open source software.

484
00:25:37.162 --> 00:25:41.711
<v Heather>I met other lawyers just, you
know, who were not clients or

485
00:25:41.771 --> 00:25:44.016
<v Heather>colleagues who were interested in
it.

486
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.530
<v Heather>And I would say maybe the
relationship I had with them was a

487
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.667
<v Heather>little bit of frenemies, you you
know, because we were competing

488
00:25:50.728 --> 00:25:51.370
<v Heather>with each other.

489
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.189
<v Heather>But but on the other hand, there

490
00:25:54.249 --> 00:25:58.187
<v Heather>weren't so many of us that we
could really afford not to

491
00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:00.334
<v Heather>collaborate, you know.

492
00:26:02.924 --> 00:26:05.329
<v Heather>And and then like there developed

493
00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:09.365
<v Heather>a lot of other categories of
people involved, like community

494
00:26:09.425 --> 00:26:10.148
<v Heather>managers.

495
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.167
<v Heather>So these may not actually be

496
00:26:12.207 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Heather>developers, but maybe they're
people who help bring open source

497
00:26:17.171 --> 00:26:18.274
<v Heather>developers together.

498
00:26:19.424 --> 00:26:20.950
<v Heather>There were business people who

499
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:26.711
<v Heather>wanted to, you know, use open
source in their business or use

500
00:26:26.772 --> 00:26:28.275
<v Heather>open source as a business tool.

501
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.068
<v Heather>So those were those are some of

502
00:26:31.108 --> 00:26:35.170
<v Heather>the main stakeholders that I
started to interact with over

503
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.431
<v Heather>time.

504
00:26:36.064 --> 00:26:36.809
<v Heather>Yeah.

505
00:26:37.542 --> 00:26:46.004
<v Zack>Did any of those kind of early
projects like really pique your

506
00:26:46.044 --> 00:26:49.172
<v Zack>interest or when did you start to
see open source as something

507
00:26:49.393 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Zack>transformative?
I really saw it as transformative

508
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:55.494
<v Heather>almost from the beginning.

509
00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.867
<v Heather>I did not realize and I'm not sure

510
00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:03.085
<v Heather>very many people would have
realized at that time how huge it

511
00:27:03.125 --> 00:27:03.568
<v Heather>would get.

512
00:27:04.382 --> 00:27:08.032
<v Heather>But it was just so different from

513
00:27:08.332 --> 00:27:13.433
<v Heather>everything else that you learned
as a technology lawyer.

514
00:27:14.262 --> 00:27:19.404
<v Heather>Like if you do a regular software
license, you know, it has a

515
00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:23.715
<v Heather>particular form and some terms
that you would expect.

516
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.313
<v Heather>So there's a there's like an
industry practice about that.

517
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.373
<v Heather>Open source is like bizarro world
licensing.

518
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.009
<v Heather>It's like exactly the opposite.

519
00:27:34.009 --> 00:27:35.505
<v Heather>It's It's like giving away rights

520
00:27:35.726 --> 00:27:39.525
<v Heather>and forcing people to give away
rights instead of just like normal

521
00:27:39.565 --> 00:27:44.226
<v Heather>licensing is like just granting
the minimum little thing necessary

522
00:27:44.286 --> 00:27:45.130
<v Heather>to get the deal done.

523
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.289
<v Heather>But like being as stingy as

524
00:27:47.369 --> 00:27:47.891
<v Heather>possible.

525
00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.084
<v Heather>That's like what you do with

526
00:27:49.124 --> 00:27:51.132
<v Heather>proprietary license with open
source.

527
00:27:51.132 --> 00:27:52.347
<v Heather>You You just like here it is.

528
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.107
<v Heather>Do whatever you want with it.

529
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Heather>And there are very few
limitations.

530
00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.174
<v Heather>If you got to really think hard
about like what what are those?

531
00:28:01.782 --> 00:28:05.333
<v Heather>Those they're not really
limitations like conditions.

532
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.091
<v Heather>What does conditions mean and how
do you comply with those?

533
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.411
<v Heather>So it was just totally different.

534
00:28:11.604 --> 00:28:13.108
<v Heather>And I like that about it because

535
00:28:13.148 --> 00:28:16.827
<v Heather>there's a lot of mental gymnastics
like involved in trying to switch

536
00:28:16.927 --> 00:28:18.453
<v Heather>from one paradigm to the other.

537
00:28:21.625 --> 00:28:26.434
<v Zack>What how how do those differences

538
00:28:26.574 --> 00:28:29.459
<v Zack>between open source and kind of
proprietary systems?

539
00:28:32.386 --> 00:28:37.154
<v Zack>What kind of changes does that
create, both from a business

540
00:28:37.254 --> 00:28:43.816
<v Zack>context, from how people interact?
I'm going to see it's huge.

541
00:28:43.816 --> 00:28:43.846
<v Heather>I it's huge.

542
00:28:43.846 --> 00:28:46.390
<v Heather>I mean, you know, if you look back

543
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.737
<v Heather>before so open source is used
before.

544
00:28:48.737 --> 00:28:49.256
<v Heather>Open source is used by everybody
is used before.

545
00:28:49.256 --> 00:28:49.548
<v Heather>Open source is used by everybody
now.

546
00:28:50.881 --> 00:28:53.990
<v Heather>Like almost everyone in the
technology industry now actually

547
00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.253
<v Heather>contributes to it.

548
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.107
<v Heather>I mean, it's everywhere.

549
00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.029
<v Heather>We're using it right this minute
to do this interview.

550
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.705
<v Heather>It's in your phone.

551
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:02.642
<v Heather>It's everywhere, right?

552
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:10.853
<v Heather>And if you go back, I guess, 25
years, the notion that that

553
00:29:11.033 --> 00:29:16.171
<v Heather>private companies would do
collaborate was not an idea.

554
00:29:17.743 --> 00:29:20.693
<v Heather>I mean, it wasn't a thing that it
wasn't a thing.

555
00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.082
<v Heather>Right.

556
00:29:22.663 --> 00:29:24.987
<v Heather>And and today you have all these

557
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:29.822
<v Heather>like big organizations and
companies collaborating on things

558
00:29:29.983 --> 00:29:31.530
<v Heather>and giving stuff away.

559
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.091
<v Heather>And that just wasn't done.

560
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.710
<v Heather>I would say open source changed
the entire face of technology

561
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:43.231
<v Heather>because it it changed a paradigm
for how people interact.

562
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:47.611
<v Heather>You know, they were just strictly
competitors and now they're

563
00:29:47.972 --> 00:29:48.754
<v Heather>collaborators.

564
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.566
<v Heather>And even there are there are only

565
00:29:51.987 --> 00:29:55.983
<v Heather>like maybe two, three companies
that are known for not doing it

566
00:29:56.104 --> 00:29:56.285
<v Heather>now.

567
00:29:56.741 --> 00:29:56.942
<v Heather>Right.

568
00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.051
<v Heather>If you go back 25 years, like no
one was doing it.

569
00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.871
<v Heather>They were terrified about what
these licenses meant and

570
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:03.212
<v Heather>everything.

571
00:30:03.842 --> 00:30:06.069
<v Heather>So it's completely been absorbed

572
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:06.672
<v Heather>in business.

573
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.146
<v Heather>And that, you know, if you believe

574
00:30:09.186 --> 00:30:12.461
<v Heather>in markets, which I do because I
studied economics and all that

575
00:30:12.481 --> 00:30:16.333
<v Heather>stuff, that wouldn't happen unless
it worked.

576
00:30:16.801 --> 00:30:16.963
<v Heather>Right.

577
00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:19.410
<v Heather>It actually works as a paradigm.

578
00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.712
<v Heather>Like it produced a lot of really
great stuff.

579
00:30:23.581 --> 00:30:28.252
<v Heather>And over that time, people became
convinced of that and they

580
00:30:28.392 --> 00:30:31.707
<v Heather>overcame their fear about these
licensing paradigms they didn't

581
00:30:31.727 --> 00:30:32.370
<v Heather>understand.

582
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.588
<v Heather>So they got over the fear and then

583
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:37.253
<v Heather>it really changed their behavior.

584
00:30:38.563 --> 00:30:40.648
<v Heather>So to me, it's changed everything

585
00:30:40.728 --> 00:30:43.195
<v Heather>about the way the technology
industry operates.

586
00:30:48.105 --> 00:30:51.152
<v Zack>Kind of looking back on your
interactions with clients, and you

587
00:30:51.192 --> 00:30:54.387
<v Zack>mentioned earlier that kind of as
being a lawyer is almost also

588
00:30:54.447 --> 00:30:56.073
<v Zack>being a business advisor.

589
00:30:57.823 --> 00:30:59.848
<v Zack>Whether, you know, what if any

590
00:30:59.888 --> 00:31:03.640
<v Zack>moments kind of stand out in your
mind where whether it was was

591
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.311
<v Zack>resistance to the idea of open
source or where it just like

592
00:31:07.612 --> 00:31:09.307
<v Zack>clicked or like how you approach
that?

593
00:31:13.387 --> 00:31:14.833
<v Heather>That's a tough question.

594
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.325
<v Heather>I don't remember one instance so

595
00:31:17.365 --> 00:31:22.641
<v Heather>much as it seems to me like I've
spent decades now talking people

596
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:25.793
<v Heather>off the ledge because they're
frightened.

597
00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:28.772
<v Heather>Everyone's frightened of things
they don't understand.

598
00:31:28.941 --> 00:31:29.122
<v Heather>Right.

599
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:35.108
<v Heather>So I spent many, many hours just

600
00:31:35.288 --> 00:31:41.483
<v Heather>explaining how things worked and
trying to reduce people's level of

601
00:31:41.604 --> 00:31:41.825
<v Heather>fear.

602
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.946
<v Heather>And by the way, that's not a

603
00:31:44.107 --> 00:31:45.592
<v Heather>normal task for a lawyer.

604
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.625
<v Heather>Like most lawyers have the task of

605
00:31:47.726 --> 00:31:50.574
<v Heather>identifying risks and warning
people about stuff.

606
00:31:51.402 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Heather>My career has been almost the
opposite, like saying, no, you

607
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.664
<v Heather>really don't need to worry about
this.

608
00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.331
<v Heather>Yes, it's a theoretical risk, but
in the end of the day, it won't

609
00:32:00.391 --> 00:32:00.773
<v Heather>matter.

610
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.148
<v Heather>And and so that's what I remember

611
00:32:04.248 --> 00:32:06.474
<v Heather>is like years and years of doing
that.

612
00:32:07.163 --> 00:32:08.910
<v Zack>Where do you think that comes
from?

613
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.732
<v Zack>That kind of opposite disposition
that you that you seem to have?

614
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.611
<v Heather>Well, maybe I, you know, maybe I
never should have been a lawyer.

615
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.514
<v Heather>You know, that's that's certainly,
you know, open to question.

616
00:32:20.641 --> 00:32:20.862
<v Heather>Right.

617
00:32:22.844 --> 00:32:24.448
<v Heather>Because I think my personality is

618
00:32:24.489 --> 00:32:26.714
<v Heather>not is a little different from
most lawyers.

619
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.247
<v Heather>I'm very practical.

620
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.451
<v Heather>And and maybe that's why I liked

621
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:33.494
<v Heather>programming, too.

622
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.669
<v Heather>You know, I'm I'm a very practical

623
00:32:35.749 --> 00:32:35.910
<v Heather>type.

624
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.170
<v Heather>I think I am an engineer at heart.

625
00:32:38.981 --> 00:32:45.855
<v Heather>And so I like to create stuff and
I like to create procedures and so

626
00:32:45.915 --> 00:32:46.236
<v Heather>forth.

627
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.608
<v Heather>And I like to build stuff.

628
00:32:48.763 --> 00:32:52.454
<v Heather>And and that's not really a lawyer
personality.

629
00:32:54.085 --> 00:32:56.633
<v Heather>I don't know where I got that, but
I don't remember getting it.

630
00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.190
<v Heather>I think I just came into the
situation with it.

631
00:32:59.701 --> 00:32:59.902
<v Zack>Yeah.

632
00:33:00.281 --> 00:33:00.462
<v Zack>Yeah.

633
00:33:00.982 --> 00:33:01.465
<v Zack>It's interesting.

634
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.445
<v Zack>You mentioned before, though, it's

635
00:33:03.565 --> 00:33:07.723
<v Zack>both like maybe you like creating
rules, but you also mentioned how

636
00:33:07.823 --> 00:33:11.353
<v Zack>there is or it seemed to me like
almost a certain freedom, at least

637
00:33:11.393 --> 00:33:12.704
<v Zack>when you were you were
programming, where you're not

638
00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:15.133
<v Zack>bound, but, you know, by the real
world.

639
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.352
<v Zack>It's like this pure it's this pure
creative endeavor.

640
00:33:18.352 --> 00:33:18.380
<v Zack>Yeah.

641
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:18.380
<v UNKNOWN>Yeah.

642
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.828
<v Heather>Well, to me, that's what it was.

643
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.122
<v Heather>Yeah.

644
00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:21.821
<v Zack>Yeah.

645
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.365
<v Zack>So so talk me through some of the

646
00:33:24.425 --> 00:33:29.023
<v Zack>other kind of inflection points in
your career as you then progressed

647
00:33:29.144 --> 00:33:30.670
<v Zack>as you met.

648
00:33:31.181 --> 00:33:32.267
<v Zack>Can you meet more people?

649
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.473
<v Zack>What were some of the main
inflection points from there?

650
00:33:37.804 --> 00:33:40.213
<v Heather>Well, I changed law firms a couple
of times.

651
00:33:42.764 --> 00:33:48.715
<v Heather>You know, I was at one place and I
just felt like I wasn't succeeding

652
00:33:48.795 --> 00:33:49.036
<v Heather>there.

653
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.631
<v Heather>And that was an important life

654
00:33:52.712 --> 00:33:53.113
<v Heather>lesson.

655
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.709
<v Heather>And it was kind of painful, but it

656
00:33:55.769 --> 00:33:56.331
<v Heather>turned out OK.

657
00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.767
<v Heather>You know, part of the problem I

658
00:33:59.787 --> 00:34:03.002
<v Heather>had, I think, was that being an
open source lawyer was not really

659
00:34:03.042 --> 00:34:03.425
<v Heather>a thing.

660
00:34:03.961 --> 00:34:04.142
<v Heather>Right.

661
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.192
<v Heather>And and the people I worked with
didn't even understand, like they

662
00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:09.585
<v Heather>didn't even think it was
important.

663
00:34:09.585 --> 00:34:13.472
<v Heather>They They didn't particularly
value this expertise.

664
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.092
<v Heather>My clients valued it, but the
people I was working for didn't.

665
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.552
<v Heather>And so I just thought I need to be
somewhere where I can just kind of

666
00:34:23.911 --> 00:34:27.889
<v Heather>carve my own path because I didn't
want to go on the paths that were

667
00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:28.452
<v Heather>available.

668
00:34:30.545 --> 00:34:32.929
<v Heather>And nobody was going to go say,

669
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:34.755
<v Heather>oh, we have an open source expert.

670
00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.047
<v Heather>Isn't that a great thing?

671
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:36.562
<v Heather>Right.

672
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.067
<v Heather>Today they would.

673
00:34:38.782 --> 00:34:43.634
<v Heather>But but at the time, no, like it
just wasn't recognized as a career

674
00:34:43.674 --> 00:34:43.955
<v Heather>path.

675
00:34:44.902 --> 00:34:46.665
<v Heather>So that was a little painful

676
00:34:46.725 --> 00:34:51.155
<v Heather>because I had to move and I felt
kind of like a failure.

677
00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:56.833
<v Heather>And but it was also a real
learning experience.

678
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:03.293
<v Heather>And, you know, what I would say
about that is that everybody goes

679
00:35:03.353 --> 00:35:04.315
<v Heather>through those things.

680
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.765
<v Heather>Like if you look at people and

681
00:35:06.825 --> 00:35:10.761
<v Heather>they seem to just have succeeded
one in one thing after another,

682
00:35:11.405 --> 00:35:12.188
<v Heather>nobody does that.

683
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:12.782
<v Heather>Right.

684
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.808
<v Heather>Everybody crashes and burns.

685
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.128
<v Heather>And and it's it's about how you

686
00:35:17.168 --> 00:35:17.911
<v Heather>react to that.

687
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.268
<v Heather>It's not you know, it's not you

688
00:35:20.308 --> 00:35:21.492
<v Heather>can't avoid it in life.

689
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:21.822
<v Heather>Right.

690
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.987
<v Heather>You're going to have setbacks.

691
00:35:23.922 --> 00:35:26.628
<v Heather>Um, but I'm extremely persistent

692
00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:29.275
<v Heather>and I was very interested in the
topic.

693
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Heather>And I just thought, well, I must
find a situation where I can do

694
00:35:32.491 --> 00:35:32.651
<v Heather>this.

695
00:35:33.541 --> 00:35:36.126
<v Heather>The other thing is, um, I made a

696
00:35:36.187 --> 00:35:41.103
<v Heather>decision along the line that what
I wanted from my law practice was

697
00:35:41.203 --> 00:35:44.313
<v Heather>to be the best lawyer I could be
like.

698
00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.930
<v Heather>And I wanted to be the best in
this area.

699
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.869
<v Heather>You know, I wanted to to pursue
excellence.

700
00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:55.173
<v Heather>And that is not the same as
pursuing money.

701
00:35:56.001 --> 00:36:01.535
<v Heather>I mean, they do interact a lot at
a good law firm.

702
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:01.962
<v Heather>Right.

703
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.429
<v Heather>But but I could have done other

704
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:06.573
<v Heather>things to make more money.

705
00:36:07.464 --> 00:36:09.110
<v Heather>And I mean, don't get me wrong.

706
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.771
<v Heather>I've been a partner at a big law
firm for many years, and it's, you

707
00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:14.203
<v Heather>know, very well paying job.

708
00:36:15.362 --> 00:36:18.011
<v Heather>But but that was an important

709
00:36:18.131 --> 00:36:18.532
<v Heather>choice.

710
00:36:19.041 --> 00:36:20.186
<v Heather>You know, I could have gone in a

711
00:36:20.247 --> 00:36:20.950
<v Heather>different direction.

712
00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.086
<v Heather>I probably wouldn't have been as

713
00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:22.830
<v Heather>specialized.

714
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.126
<v Heather>I would have done different kinds

715
00:36:24.167 --> 00:36:24.388
<v Heather>of work.

716
00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.684
<v Heather>But what gets me out of bed every

717
00:36:26.925 --> 00:36:31.080
<v Heather>morning at my desk is not like,
oh, I'm going to make a lot a lot

718
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:34.231
<v Heather>of money today or even I'm going
to make a lot of money for my

719
00:36:34.291 --> 00:36:35.073
<v Heather>clients today.

720
00:36:35.073 --> 00:36:36.725
<v Heather>It's It's like I just want to do

721
00:36:36.785 --> 00:36:39.493
<v Heather>something really difficult and
interesting.

722
00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.650
<v Heather>Like, that's what I wanted to do.

723
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.106
<v Heather>And it's important to know, you

724
00:36:44.608 --> 00:36:47.074
<v Heather>know, what you want out of a
career.

725
00:36:48.184 --> 00:36:50.232
<v Heather>And you never know it when you're
starting out.

726
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.567
<v Heather>You learn that over time.

727
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.951
<v Heather>So so I made choices that led me

728
00:36:56.012 --> 00:36:56.754
<v Heather>down that path.

729
00:36:59.123 --> 00:37:02.589
<v Zack>And so what did that look like to

730
00:37:02.629 --> 00:37:08.644
<v Zack>then, you know, you left the the
law firm felt like they didn't

731
00:37:08.684 --> 00:37:12.174
<v Zack>necessarily appreciate open source
in the way that you did.

732
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.650
<v Zack>And here's the thing, that there
is this opportunity to dive into

733
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.861
<v Zack>it more and pursue it.

734
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.890
<v Zack>So what what did you do?

735
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.630
<v Heather>Well, in fact, they told me and
this is this is kind of

736
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.154
<v Heather>astonishing at this point.

737
00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.490
<v Heather>But I was told we don't really

738
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.453
<v Heather>need people.

739
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.809
<v Heather>This is at a technology law firm,

740
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.930
<v Heather>too.

741
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.766
<v Heather>We don't really need people with

742
00:37:33.846 --> 00:37:35.011
<v Heather>software expertise.

743
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.303
<v Heather>I mean, it's like such a

744
00:37:36.363 --> 00:37:40.574
<v Heather>ridiculous statement because then
the entire world, like as Andreas

745
00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.409
<v Heather>said, like software ate the world.

746
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:42.722
<v Heather>Right.

747
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:47.728
<v Heather>Like, why would you even say that?
But that was just that that

748
00:37:47.748 --> 00:37:49.052
<v Heather>situation just was what it was.

749
00:37:50.481 --> 00:37:52.887
<v Heather>And and so, you know, I left and

750
00:37:52.907 --> 00:37:56.581
<v Heather>just went to another firm and I
went to a place where they were a

751
00:37:56.621 --> 00:38:00.393
<v Heather>lot more agnostic about what your
practice was.

752
00:38:01.602 --> 00:38:06.213
<v Heather>Basically, I interviewed at this
place and I was talking to the guy

753
00:38:06.253 --> 00:38:09.551
<v Heather>that ran the firm and he asked me
what I did.

754
00:38:09.551 --> 00:38:12.111
<v Heather>And And I said, oh, I'm a
specialist in open source.

755
00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.189
<v Heather>And I explained something about my
practice.

756
00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.351
<v Heather>And he said, I have no idea what
you're talking about, but I have a

757
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:19.562
<v Heather>couple of questions for you.

758
00:38:20.363 --> 00:38:21.469
<v Heather>Do you have clients?

759
00:38:21.941 --> 00:38:23.549
<v Heather>I said, oh, yeah, I've got a lot
of clients.

760
00:38:24.204 --> 00:38:27.350
<v Heather>Do they pay you?
I said, oh, yeah, they pay me.

761
00:38:27.801 --> 00:38:28.807
<v Heather>They're glad to pay me.

762
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.149
<v Heather>He's like, great, you know.

763
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.991
<v Heather>And so I really needed an
environment like that.

764
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.249
<v Heather>By the way, props were due.

765
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.788
<v Heather>That was Greenberg, Trorig.

766
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.430
<v Heather>And and they they were just so
wonderful because they gave me

767
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:46.022
<v Heather>this opportunity to make my own
way.

768
00:38:46.022 --> 00:38:50.773
<v Heather>And And and that was that was huge
for me.

769
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.731
<v Heather>You know, I it was it's scary
because then you've got to

770
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:55.433
<v Heather>perform.

771
00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:55.581
<v Heather>Right.

772
00:38:55.581 --> 00:38:55.581
<v Heather>Right.

773
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.806
<v Heather>But but that was the kind of place

774
00:38:58.926 --> 00:39:02.221
<v Heather>where they were like, look, if
you've got a good practice, we

775
00:39:02.282 --> 00:39:02.806
<v Heather>welcome you.

776
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.826
<v Heather>And it was it was less about their

777
00:39:04.906 --> 00:39:07.564
<v Heather>mission than about the mission of
the people that worked there.

778
00:39:09.223 --> 00:39:13.112
<v Zack>And what did that feel like to
kind of have this, again, like

779
00:39:13.192 --> 00:39:17.749
<v Zack>antithesis kind of thing where it
was like, oh, it's almost like,

780
00:39:17.769 --> 00:39:19.033
<v Zack>you know, you're a VC.

781
00:39:19.461 --> 00:39:20.327
<v Zack>Oh, do you have traction?

782
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.828
<v Zack>OK, well, there must be something
here.

783
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.491
<v Zack>I don't I don't know if I get it
or not, but the market says that

784
00:39:25.632 --> 00:39:26.073
<v Zack>that there's.

785
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:26.946
<v Zack>Yeah, exactly.

786
00:39:26.946 --> 00:39:28.647
<v Zack>Like, Like, what was what was that
like?

787
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.072
<v Zack>And what did that feel like to
have someone kind of embrace you?

788
00:39:33.441 --> 00:39:35.189
<v Zack>Oh, it was it was great.

789
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.326
<v Heather>I really felt appreciated and I

790
00:39:37.366 --> 00:39:40.161
<v Heather>really needed that at that point,
you know, because I had been

791
00:39:40.201 --> 00:39:42.791
<v Heather>through this, you know, sort of
difficult transition.

792
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:48.272
<v Heather>And and I and I, like I said, I'm
forever grateful that there was

793
00:39:48.312 --> 00:39:52.530
<v Heather>that opportunity, you know,
because I could have not run into

794
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.493
<v Heather>that opportunity.

795
00:39:56.005 --> 00:39:57.589
<v Heather>And another thing is that, like,

796
00:39:57.769 --> 00:39:59.954
<v Heather>it matters how people run
businesses.

797
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.292
<v Heather>You know, it's not you hear all
the corporate messaging in a place

798
00:40:04.332 --> 00:40:04.733
<v Heather>you work.

799
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:06.669
<v Heather>And that matters.

800
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:07.907
<v Heather>Like the culture matters.

801
00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.427
<v Heather>And that particular business, like

802
00:40:11.727 --> 00:40:15.882
<v Heather>the first firm I worked at, you
would go to a company event and

803
00:40:15.922 --> 00:40:18.291
<v Heather>they would say they had a mission
statement.

804
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.868
<v Heather>Here's our mission statement.

805
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.206
<v Heather>Come along for the ride.

806
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.751
<v Heather>And then I went to Greenberg and
they and we would have a meeting

807
00:40:25.811 --> 00:40:28.988
<v Heather>and they would say and the
management would say, how can we

808
00:40:29.049 --> 00:40:32.408
<v Heather>help you succeed?
Like, you know what you're doing,

809
00:40:32.428 --> 00:40:35.447
<v Heather>OK?
We want to hire you unless you

810
00:40:35.487 --> 00:40:36.230
<v Heather>knew what you were doing.

811
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.008
<v Heather>How do we help you succeed?

812
00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.670
<v Heather>And that was like so empowering,
right?

813
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.992
<v Heather>It's a great way to run a business
if you can run a business that

814
00:40:45.052 --> 00:40:45.273
<v Heather>way.

815
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.645
<v Heather>And and it was it was a great

816
00:40:48.725 --> 00:40:55.663
<v Heather>feeling because I really like just
having the freedom to to go in my

817
00:40:55.723 --> 00:40:56.387
<v Heather>own direction.

818
00:40:58.483 --> 00:41:00.627
<v Zack>Could you talk a little bit about

819
00:41:00.647 --> 00:41:06.561
<v Zack>kind of from from that period of
then really diving into practicing

820
00:41:06.581 --> 00:41:12.253
<v Zack>like open source law to becoming a
VC in the open source community

821
00:41:12.273 --> 00:41:14.887
<v Zack>and how in the world did that
happen?

822
00:41:15.281 --> 00:41:18.132
<v Zack>And that's a good question.

823
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.628
<v Heather>Yeah, yeah.

824
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.131
<v Heather>So I didn't really intend that to
happen.

825
00:41:22.761 --> 00:41:30.414
<v Heather>But but the the the person who
runs the VC firm, Joseph Jacks, is

826
00:41:30.514 --> 00:41:31.336
<v Heather>he's called JJ.

827
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.367
<v Heather>He just like contacted me out of

828
00:41:34.407 --> 00:41:37.842
<v Heather>the blue basically one day and
said, hey, I'm starting a fund

829
00:41:37.883 --> 00:41:39.490
<v Heather>that's around open source.

830
00:41:40.263 --> 00:41:41.650
<v Heather>Do you want to be part of it?

831
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.291
<v Heather>And my first inclination was, what
do you want me for?

832
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.645
<v Heather>Just I'm a lawyer.

833
00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.006
<v Heather>But then I talked to him more and

834
00:41:50.126 --> 00:41:54.761
<v Heather>I thought, oh, actually, this does
make a lot of sense because I had

835
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:59.553
<v Heather>been spending a lot of time
counseling people on business

836
00:41:59.613 --> 00:42:00.074
<v Heather>models.

837
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.448
<v Heather>And I I almost didn't realize how

838
00:42:03.568 --> 00:42:05.694
<v Heather>much of my time I was spending
doing that.

839
00:42:06.362 --> 00:42:09.373
<v Heather>And there was this event that took
place.

840
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.491
<v Heather>And this is kind of inside
baseball, but hopefully I can make

841
00:42:13.552 --> 00:42:14.494
<v Heather>it understandable.

842
00:42:16.644 --> 00:42:18.328
<v Heather>Somebody I knew came to me and

843
00:42:18.408 --> 00:42:21.795
<v Heather>asked me to write this license, a
new kind of license.

844
00:42:22.543 --> 00:42:24.692
<v Heather>And they asked me to do it for
free.

845
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.249
<v Heather>It wasn't a client engagement.

846
00:42:26.942 --> 00:42:28.547
<v Heather>And I said, sure, you know,

847
00:42:28.567 --> 00:42:30.914
<v Heather>because I always help people do
stuff, you know.

848
00:42:32.042 --> 00:42:37.633
<v Zack>And and so I wrote this thing or I
actually led the drafting on is

849
00:42:37.693 --> 00:42:38.675
<v Zack>probably more accurate.

850
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.545
<v Heather>And it got released and it was

851
00:42:40.786 --> 00:42:42.452
<v Heather>enormously controversial.

852
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.925
<v Heather>This was something called the

853
00:42:43.986 --> 00:42:45.031
<v Heather>Commons Clause.

854
00:42:45.822 --> 00:42:50.733
<v Heather>And and I was roundly criticized

855
00:42:50.753 --> 00:42:51.214
<v Heather>for doing this.

856
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.264
<v Heather>I mean, you know, there was all

857
00:42:53.344 --> 00:42:58.435
<v Heather>sorts of trolling and flame wars
and stuff over this thing.

858
00:42:59.562 --> 00:43:03.991
<v Heather>And and I thought to myself at
that point, oh, my goodness, you

859
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:05.795
<v Heather>know, I did this for free.

860
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.405
<v Heather>And, you know, no good deed goes

861
00:43:07.485 --> 00:43:09.111
<v Heather>unpunished and all this sort of
thing.

862
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:14.394
<v Heather>But then it turned out that
although that particular project

863
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.131
<v Heather>didn't really fly for a variety of
reasons, people wanted to do

864
00:43:18.271 --> 00:43:19.154
<v Heather>similar things.

865
00:43:19.882 --> 00:43:21.065
<v Heather>And they were very interested in

866
00:43:21.506 --> 00:43:25.367
<v Heather>like the concept that this
involved, a concept I didn't come

867
00:43:25.427 --> 00:43:25.749
<v Heather>up with.

868
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.867
<v Heather>I just wrote the thing.

869
00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.301
<v Heather>Right.

870
00:43:28.064 --> 00:43:29.469
<v Heather>People told me what they want and

871
00:43:29.489 --> 00:43:30.372
<v Heather>I wrote it for them.

872
00:43:31.443 --> 00:43:33.089
<v Heather>And so I was just a craftsman

873
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.431
<v Heather>there.

874
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.565
<v Heather>But then people started coming to

875
00:43:35.585 --> 00:43:37.833
<v Heather>me and saying, well, I want to do
something like that.

876
00:43:37.833 --> 00:43:43.591
<v Heather>And And and so over the course of
maybe a year, I probably did a

877
00:43:44.373 --> 00:43:49.513
<v Heather>project like that for several
dozen companies.

878
00:43:49.513 --> 00:43:51.389
<v Heather>I I mean, that's a lot of
companies.

879
00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.731
<v Heather>You know, that's a lot of clients
in that amount of time.

880
00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:03.775
<v Heather>So so I that involved a lot of
discussion about business models.

881
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.068
<v Heather>So I kind of fell into this thing
just because somebody asked me to

882
00:44:07.169 --> 00:44:09.094
<v Heather>do something for them.

883
00:44:10.223 --> 00:44:12.289
<v Heather>And and then all of a sudden, like

884
00:44:12.369 --> 00:44:14.074
<v Heather>I was the person doing this thing.

885
00:44:15.182 --> 00:44:18.711
<v Heather>And I have to say that, you know,

886
00:44:18.751 --> 00:44:22.910
<v Heather>that changed my whole career
because I started doing different

887
00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:23.452
<v Heather>kind of work.

888
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.025
<v Heather>And that's kind of how I got into

889
00:44:25.065 --> 00:44:30.109
<v Heather>the business model counseling more
than just kind of the pure

890
00:44:30.189 --> 00:44:31.453
<v Heather>licensing analysis.

891
00:44:31.841 --> 00:44:33.345
<v Heather>I did a favor for someone which

892
00:44:33.766 --> 00:44:36.884
<v Heather>seemed to be a very bad idea at
the beginning, but it turned out

893
00:44:36.904 --> 00:44:37.949
<v Heather>to be a very good idea.

894
00:44:40.225 --> 00:44:42.170
<v Zack>I mean, maybe not not so different

895
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.266
<v Zack>than the first client who said,
hey, what do you think about this

896
00:44:45.306 --> 00:44:46.523
<v Zack>license?
I don't know.

897
00:44:46.543 --> 00:44:47.086
<v Zack>Let me go look.

898
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.283
<v Heather>Oh, absolutely.

899
00:44:48.344 --> 00:44:50.291
<v Heather>Because like this was also new.

900
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.089
<v Heather>This is new territory, too.

901
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:57.382
<v Heather>But and and I guess, you know,
there are probably it would have

902
00:44:57.402 --> 00:45:00.646
<v Heather>been a lot of people who would
have said, no way I won't do that,

903
00:45:00.947 --> 00:45:01.871
<v Heather>particularly for free.

904
00:45:04.546 --> 00:45:06.111
<v Heather>But but I said, yeah, sure.

905
00:45:06.151 --> 00:45:06.733
<v Heather>Sign me up.

906
00:45:08.403 --> 00:45:10.627
<v Zack>There might be some some similar

907
00:45:10.768 --> 00:45:14.856
<v Zack>ethos there around free free and
open source software.

908
00:45:15.222 --> 00:45:16.970
<v Zack>Yeah, absolutely.

909
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.347
<v Heather>I mean, my my whole philosophy,

910
00:45:19.407 --> 00:45:23.928
<v Heather>like for all these years has been
if somebody asked me to help, I

911
00:45:23.968 --> 00:45:24.991
<v Heather>help them if I can.

912
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.448
<v Heather>Like and whether it's going to

913
00:45:27.488 --> 00:45:30.791
<v Heather>result in pain, work or not is
kind of secondary for me.

914
00:45:32.586 --> 00:45:34.452
<v Heather>And I'm not sure.

915
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.064
<v Heather>Again, I'm not sure that's a way

916
00:45:36.104 --> 00:45:38.773
<v Heather>to make the most money, you know,
or be.

917
00:45:39.663 --> 00:45:42.412
<v Heather>But actually, I think it does make
you successful.

918
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.672
<v Heather>Like paying it forward really
works in a service business.

919
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:51.713
<v Heather>And it's also makes you happier, I
think, because you get to help

920
00:45:51.773 --> 00:45:52.074
<v Heather>people.

921
00:45:52.201 --> 00:45:53.307
<v Heather>I like helping people.

922
00:45:55.384 --> 00:45:59.513
<v Zack>Where do you think you'd be
without open source if open source

923
00:45:59.614 --> 00:46:03.852
<v Zack>never existed?
A starving drummer?

924
00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:09.827
<v Heather>No, I might be a starving
musician, but more likely I'd just

925
00:46:09.867 --> 00:46:12.795
<v Heather>be doing like M&A deals, which is
fine.

926
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:18.032
<v Heather>You know, I've done tons of them,
but but it it wouldn't have been

927
00:46:18.092 --> 00:46:19.094
<v Heather>as wild a ride.

928
00:46:19.521 --> 00:46:20.868
<v Heather>Open source is crazy.

929
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.310
<v Heather>Like every time you think that
you've seen everything, something

930
00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.435
<v Heather>absolutely crazy happens.

931
00:46:28.122 --> 00:46:29.708
<v Heather>Somebody is doing something

932
00:46:29.869 --> 00:46:30.812
<v Heather>totally nuts.

933
00:46:31.562 --> 00:46:32.987
<v Heather>And you wake up and you read the

934
00:46:33.067 --> 00:46:36.247
<v Heather>news and you're like, what?
How could this happen?

935
00:46:37.162 --> 00:46:41.093
<v Heather>And and it's it's scary, but fun.

936
00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.669
<v Heather>It doesn't happen so much in like

937
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:44.512
<v Heather>M&A deals.

938
00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:50.890
<v Zack>Would it be worth in the last few

939
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:53.295
<v Zack>minutes that we have here talking
about Google versus Oracle?

940
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.369
<v Zack>That was a big deal and you were
involved.

941
00:46:55.801 --> 00:46:55.962
<v Zack>Yeah.

942
00:46:55.962 --> 00:46:58.949
<v Zack>Yeah, Yeah, that was an amazing

943
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.832
<v Zack>experience.

944
00:47:00.341 --> 00:47:00.684
<v Heather>It was.

945
00:47:01.624 --> 00:47:02.849
<v Heather>I mean, I think for most.

946
00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:04.664
<v Heather>Well, there aren't so many

947
00:47:04.745 --> 00:47:07.213
<v Heather>software copyright lawyers running
around out there.

948
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.811
<v Heather>But for those of us in that area,
that was like the case of the

949
00:47:10.912 --> 00:47:11.413
<v Heather>century.

950
00:47:12.281 --> 00:47:15.167
<v Heather>And it was also between two big

951
00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:19.216
<v Heather>companies that had a lot of money
to litigate.

952
00:47:20.284 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Heather>And I loved working with Google.

953
00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.848
<v Heather>I mean, they're a great client to

954
00:47:24.868 --> 00:47:25.210
<v Heather>work with.

955
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.969
<v Heather>And I just got it was so great to

956
00:47:29.009 --> 00:47:31.174
<v Heather>get to work on a landmark thing
like that.

957
00:47:31.174 --> 00:47:34.993
<v Heather>And And I also thought it was
really important to the industry.

958
00:47:35.884 --> 00:47:37.311
<v Heather>And I'm really glad we won.

959
00:47:39.065 --> 00:47:40.670
<v Zack>Could you, you know, for the sake

960
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:44.810
<v Zack>of history, I mean, could you talk
just what were the implications of

961
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.068
<v Zack>the case?
What was at stake in kind of what

962
00:47:47.249 --> 00:47:52.650
<v Zack>was it about?
Well, on a on a doctrinal level,

963
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:59.208
<v Heather>it was about whether you could
copy the interface of some

964
00:47:59.269 --> 00:48:01.795
<v Heather>software in order to reengineer
it.

965
00:48:02.561 --> 00:48:10.554
<v Heather>So so if if if there's some
software and you don't like that

966
00:48:10.594 --> 00:48:13.344
<v Heather>software for a variety of reasons
like you don't like the way it

967
00:48:13.384 --> 00:48:17.001
<v Heather>works or you don't like the
licensing for it or whatever, can

968
00:48:17.021 --> 00:48:19.891
<v Heather>you take the interface for it and
redo it yourself?

969
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:26.213
<v Heather>Because that's basically what
Google did with Android and as

970
00:48:26.253 --> 00:48:29.149
<v Heather>opposed to Java, which was what
Oracle owned.

971
00:48:29.942 --> 00:48:35.334
<v Heather>And and there was and before that
case in the software industry,

972
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:40.012
<v Heather>pretty much everyone assumed you
could do that and not have

973
00:48:40.353 --> 00:48:41.034
<v Heather>liability.

974
00:48:41.783 --> 00:48:43.611
<v Heather>And then this lawsuit happened.

975
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:47.012
<v Heather>And in fact, the law was not very
clear about it.

976
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:50.753
<v Heather>And because you had two parties
with a lot of money to litigate,

977
00:48:52.403 --> 00:48:57.814
<v Heather>you know, there was just every
issue got, you know, argued to the

978
00:48:57.954 --> 00:48:58.275
<v Heather>max.

979
00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:58.880
<v Heather>Right.

980
00:49:00.563 --> 00:49:08.175
<v Heather>And eventually, the Supreme Court
decided that that Google could do

981
00:49:08.255 --> 00:49:09.700
<v Heather>what they did in that case.

982
00:49:09.761 --> 00:49:12.427
<v Heather>But but the decision was, I think,

983
00:49:12.507 --> 00:49:16.081
<v Heather>unfortunately, a little bit
limited to its facts, pretty much,

984
00:49:17.265 --> 00:49:20.554
<v Heather>which was that they could do that
in that case.

985
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.571
<v Heather>But that doesn't mean that you
could go to the next situation and

986
00:49:24.631 --> 00:49:25.333
<v Heather>also do it.

987
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.723
<v Heather>It was under something called a

988
00:49:26.783 --> 00:49:29.752
<v Heather>fair use doctrine, which is very
fact specific.

989
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:34.188
<v Heather>And, you know, ironically, one of
the first I remember the first

990
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:40.509
<v Heather>professional lecture I gave as a
lawyer when I was an associate was

991
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:41.873
<v Heather>on the fair use doctrine.

992
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.587
<v Heather>And I had written a paper on it in

993
00:49:43.628 --> 00:49:44.210
<v Heather>law school.

994
00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.327
<v Heather>And then I ended up doing this

995
00:49:46.408 --> 00:49:47.652
<v Heather>huge case on it.

996
00:49:49.263 --> 00:49:51.168
<v Heather>So that was interesting because

997
00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:55.164
<v Heather>it's only because I wrote this
paper in law school that I kind of

998
00:49:55.244 --> 00:49:57.472
<v Heather>knew that defense like the back of
my hand.

999
00:49:57.921 --> 00:50:01.350
<v Heather>And then, you know, I got totally
steeped in it for the 10 years of

1000
00:50:01.411 --> 00:50:04.449
<v Heather>that case, you know, working on it
on and off.

1001
00:50:05.703 --> 00:50:10.174
<v Zack>What what did it mean to you to
work on a case like that?

1002
00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:16.850
<v Heather>Well, it's great for cocktail
party conversations like there's

1003
00:50:18.333 --> 00:50:23.430
<v Heather>it's something that people outside
of my sort of immediate sphere may

1004
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:24.172
<v Heather>have heard of.

1005
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:24.761
<v Heather>Right.

1006
00:50:25.182 --> 00:50:28.813
<v Heather>Whereas open source stuff like
most of them haven't really heard

1007
00:50:28.833 --> 00:50:29.034
<v Heather>of it.

1008
00:50:30.583 --> 00:50:35.133
<v Heather>So and I think it's it's

1009
00:50:35.193 --> 00:50:36.215
<v Heather>understandable to people.

1010
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.729
<v Heather>So that's that's good.

1011
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:44.872
<v Heather>I thought it was hugely important
case because if you can't rewrite

1012
00:50:44.932 --> 00:50:49.810
<v Heather>software to suit your needs, then
I don't know what that would even

1013
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:50.192
<v Heather>mean.

1014
00:50:51.142 --> 00:50:52.505
<v Heather>I think what it would have meant

1015
00:50:52.665 --> 00:51:01.551
<v Heather>is that you if you can't do that,
then it would stifle innovation a

1016
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:02.414
<v Heather>huge amount.

1017
00:51:03.161 --> 00:51:04.845
<v Heather>Just to give an example, like

1018
00:51:05.246 --> 00:51:09.535
<v Heather>Linux, which is the operating
system that's open source site

1019
00:51:10.522 --> 00:51:14.774
<v Heather>that was created because for in
exactly the same kind of project,

1020
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:21.026
<v Heather>they took the interface for Unix,
which was a proprietary operating

1021
00:51:21.066 --> 00:51:23.293
<v Heather>system, and then just and rewrote
it.

1022
00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:30.333
<v Heather>They rewrote a new system to that
to Unix's specifications to avoid

1023
00:51:30.413 --> 00:51:32.607
<v Heather>the licensing issues with Unix.

1024
00:51:33.403 --> 00:51:35.552
<v Heather>And so if you couldn't do that.

1025
00:51:37.044 --> 00:51:40.514
<v Heather>In a way, we wouldn't have had the
open source movement at all.

1026
00:51:41.623 --> 00:51:44.951
<v Heather>A lot of open source software is
actually re-implementation of

1027
00:51:45.031 --> 00:51:46.294
<v Heather>proprietary software.

1028
00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.767
<v Heather>So that's one reason why it was

1029
00:51:48.868 --> 00:51:50.714
<v Heather>hugely important to open source.

1030
00:51:52.945 --> 00:51:54.188
<v Zack>In that sort of vein and kind of

1031
00:51:54.709 --> 00:52:00.671
<v Zack>coming to a wrap here, I mean,
where would the world be without

1032
00:52:00.731 --> 00:52:03.510
<v Zack>open source?
How has open source changed the

1033
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:05.549
<v Zack>world?
And why does it matter?

1034
00:52:05.601 --> 00:52:12.349
<v Zack>Why does it matter to you?
I guess without Linux, we would

1035
00:52:12.369 --> 00:52:17.828
<v Heather>all be just using Windows and Mac
OS, I guess, or maybe Unix.

1036
00:52:17.828 --> 00:52:17.838
<v Heather>Unix.

1037
00:52:18.763 --> 00:52:21.289
<v Heather>And one thing that would mean is

1038
00:52:21.409 --> 00:52:25.826
<v Heather>that the developing world would
have less access to software

1039
00:52:25.826 --> 00:52:28.396
<v Heather>access to software because they'd
have to pay for every copy.

1040
00:52:31.547 --> 00:52:36.716
<v Heather>The developing world couldn't,
like, localize software for their

1041
00:52:36.756 --> 00:52:38.649
<v Heather>own languages, and we would not
have had this sea languages, and

1042
00:52:38.649 --> 00:52:41.509
<v Heather>we would not have had this sea
change in business where people

1043
00:52:41.529 --> 00:52:45.161
<v Heather>now look, people now ask
businesses to be collaborative

1044
00:52:45.181 --> 00:52:48.269
<v Heather>with each other, as opposed to
just fighting with each other and

1045
00:52:48.289 --> 00:52:51.207
<v Heather>competing with each other.

1046
00:52:51.207 --> 00:52:51.231
<v Heather>I other.

1047
00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:56.077
<v Heather>I think it's it's it's changed the
technology world and it's changed

1048
00:52:56.097 --> 00:52:56.919
<v Heather>the business world.

1049
00:52:56.919 --> 00:52:56.989
<v Heather>I once did this talk called, I

1050
00:52:56.989 --> 00:52:57.089
<v Heather>think, like, it's a wonderful it's
changed the business world.

1051
00:52:57.089 --> 00:52:57.209
<v Heather>I once did this talk called, I
think, like, it's a wonderful

1052
00:52:57.209 --> 00:52:57.485
<v Heather>Linux or something.

1053
00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.362
<v Heather>Or and and it was like, it's a

1054
00:53:03.442 --> 00:53:09.336
<v Heather>wonderful life, like asking what
would the world be like without

1055
00:53:09.336 --> 00:53:14.755
<v Heather>open open source?
And of course, it was dreary.

1056
00:53:14.755 --> 00:53:14.836
<v Heather>Right, dreary.

1057
00:53:14.836 --> 00:53:15.128
<v Heather>Right, right.

1058
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:15.861
<v Heather>Doom and gloom.

1059
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.829
<v Heather>Yeah.

1060
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:25.210
<v Zack>What What are you most proud of?
What are you most proud of when

1061
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.998
<v Zack>you look back on on your career or
anything else that you'd want to

1062
00:53:27.998 --> 00:53:28.187
<v Zack>share kind of in closing?
or anything else that you'd want

1063
00:53:28.187 --> 00:53:34.453
<v Zack>to share kind of in closing?
I guess I'm most proud of what I

1064
00:53:34.614 --> 00:53:36.298
<v Zack>the knowledge I've shared with
people.

1065
00:53:36.298 --> 00:53:37.235
<v Heather>That's people.

1066
00:53:37.235 --> 00:53:38.148
<v Heather>That's really it's really

1067
00:53:38.208 --> 00:53:41.717
<v Heather>important to me to teach other
people what you know.

1068
00:53:41.782 --> 00:53:46.854
<v Heather>I mean, and even if you only know
10 percent more, it's OK, right,

1069
00:53:47.255 --> 00:53:48.218
<v Heather>to teach other people.

1070
00:53:48.218 --> 00:53:48.258
<v Heather>To teach other people.

1071
00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:48.288
<v Heather>teach other people.

1072
00:53:48.288 --> 00:53:48.328
<v Heather>To teach other people.

1073
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:53.971
<v Heather>And that's what I'm most proud
that I was able to develop a

1074
00:53:54.011 --> 00:53:58.369
<v Heather>career where I was able to do that
and still have a successful

1075
00:53:58.450 --> 00:53:58.771
<v Heather>career.

1076
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.666
<v Heather>Like, I'm glad I was able to give

1077
00:54:01.706 --> 00:54:05.620
<v Heather>so much away, because when you
look back over it, I think that's

1078
00:54:05.641 --> 00:54:08.951
<v Heather>what gives you satisfaction is
like, what did you do for other

1079
00:54:09.032 --> 00:54:12.091
<v Heather>people?
And and I think I've I've done

1080
00:54:12.131 --> 00:54:12.231
<v Heather>that.

1081
00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.584
<v Heather>I've certainly given away a lot of

1082
00:54:13.684 --> 00:54:16.613
<v Heather>books and videos and all the
knowledge that I could.

1083
00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:18.891
<v Zack>Absolutely.

1084
00:54:20.105 --> 00:54:22.032
<v Zack>Anything else before we wrap?

1085
00:54:22.784 --> 00:54:23.709
<v Heather>No, that's it.

1086
00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.228
<v Heather>I mean, it's been it's been really

1087
00:54:26.368 --> 00:54:27.993
<v Heather>fun talking about this.

1088
00:54:29.323 --> 00:54:33.152
<v Heather>I don't get asked to talk about

1089
00:54:33.232 --> 00:54:34.395
<v Heather>myself that much.

1090
00:54:34.941 --> 00:54:37.830
<v Heather>So, of course, everyone loves

1091
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:39.034
<v Heather>talking about themselves.

1092
00:54:40.082 --> 00:54:42.848
<v Heather>But it was fun to look back over

1093
00:54:43.469 --> 00:54:47.002
<v Heather>over the whole thing and, you
know, try to figure out what the

1094
00:54:47.062 --> 00:54:47.988
<v Heather>story arc is.

1095
00:54:48.905 --> 00:54:49.347
<v Zack>Absolutely.

1096
00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.612
<v Zack>Well, Heather, absolute pleasure
and honor.

1097
00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:57.093
<v Zack>And thank you for your time and
contributing your story.

1098
00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.250
<v Heather>Well, thanks for talking to me
today.

1099
00:55:00.742 --> 00:55:01.045
<v Heather>Absolutely.
