00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.000
<v Heather Meeker>Welcome to the open source
stories, digital archive, or

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.461
<v Heather Meeker>FOSSDA.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Heather Meeker>Open source has changed the world.

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Heather Meeker>And it's changed the world greatly
for the better.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Heather Meeker>It's a movement that's been going
on for quite a while now, and it

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Heather Meeker>didn't start because of a
government, or a company, or a

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.800
<v Heather Meeker>politician.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.100
<v Heather Meeker>It started really from people who

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Heather Meeker>wanted to change the way people
had access to software because

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.054
<v Heather Meeker>software is so important to our
lives now.

11
00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Heather Meeker>Whether you know it or not, you
are using open-source software

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.000
<v Heather Meeker>right now, and you're probably
using it every moment of your

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.354
<v Heather Meeker>life.

14
00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Heather Meeker>And that's due to a very dedicated

15
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Heather Meeker>group of people who started, and
who grew this movement over many

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.807
<v Heather Meeker>years.

17
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Heather Meeker>Because this is such an important

18
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.599
<v Heather Meeker>change in our world, and because
it happened in the way it did.

19
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.500
<v Heather Meeker>I thought it was important to
capture the personal stories of

20
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Heather Meeker>people involved in this movement.

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.115
<v Heather Meeker>What made them so dedicated?

22
00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:17.523
<v Heather Meeker>What made them understand that
this was so important?

23
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Heather Meeker>And so I've asked lots of my
friends, and colleagues, and

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.800
<v Heather Meeker>people I don't even know to
contribute their stories to this

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Heather Meeker>oral history, so that the
generations who go beyond and take

26
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.205
<v Heather Meeker>open source forward into the 21st
century will understand, how such

27
00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:40.807
<v Heather Meeker>a movement could have come about.

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Heather Meeker>Now, it's only fair that I tell my

29
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Heather Meeker>own story and it's certainly not
the most interesting story you're

30
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Heather Meeker>going to hear, but I was a
computer programmer a long time

31
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Heather Meeker>ago back in the 1980s.

32
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.300
<v Heather Meeker>It was so long ago, we called

33
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Heather Meeker>ourselves computer programmers
instead of software engineers.

34
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.007
<v Heather Meeker>I wrote code in compiled Basic.

35
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.400
<v Heather Meeker>Now, for people who are in the

36
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Heather Meeker>tech industry, that is, you know,
a very lightweight way of doing

37
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.700
<v Heather Meeker>computer programming, but hey, you
can't judge, because it actually

38
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.054
<v Heather Meeker>worked really well for what we
were doing at the time.

39
00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:25.400
<v Heather Meeker>But I was very interested in
software as a result.

40
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Heather Meeker>And by the way, I got into
software just by kind of talking

41
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Heather Meeker>my way into a job.

42
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Heather Meeker>It's not like you went to school

43
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Heather Meeker>to get a job in that back in those
days.

44
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Heather Meeker>And eventually, when I went to law
school and then I graduated, I

45
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.300
<v Heather Meeker>found that there was all this
really interesting stuff going on

46
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Heather Meeker>in software licensing.

47
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.946
<v Heather Meeker>My clients started to ask me,

48
00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Heather Meeker>"What about these open source
licenses?" And they were really

49
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Heather Meeker>something new.

50
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Heather Meeker>They were not like anything anyone

51
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Heather Meeker>had seen before.

52
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.500
<v Heather Meeker>And for the most part, they

53
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.300
<v Heather Meeker>weren't really written entirely by
lawyers or much like normal

54
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Heather Meeker>software licenses.

55
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Heather Meeker>Most of the people I worked with

56
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.100
<v Heather Meeker>at the time had the attitude of,
well, you know, you can't use this

57
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.500
<v Heather Meeker>stuff.

58
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Heather Meeker>We don't understand it.

59
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.200
<v Heather Meeker>You don't know where it's been.

60
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200
<v Heather Meeker>It's kind of like when your mother

61
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.000
<v Heather Meeker>says, "Don't put that in your
mouth.

62
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.500
<v Heather Meeker>You don't know where it's been."
And but my clients kept asking me

63
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.707
<v Heather Meeker>about it, and I thought that
instead of the answer just being,

64
00:03:29.707 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Heather Meeker>"No", which was the answer most
lawyers were giving it the time, I

65
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.600
<v Heather Meeker>had to say, "Yes, if..."
And so I started trying to figure

66
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.407
<v Heather Meeker>out how to do that and there
wasn't much out there.

67
00:03:41.407 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Heather Meeker>Not a lot of information out
there.

68
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600
<v Heather Meeker>And so I actually started creating
some of the information.

69
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.900
<v Heather Meeker>And I found it was just an
absolutely fascinating thing.

70
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.800
<v Heather Meeker>I mean, people get into the law
for different reasons, but I think

71
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.800
<v Heather Meeker>actually for a lot of lawyers,
they get into it because being a

72
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.900
<v Heather Meeker>lawyer is like solving all these
really intricate puzzles.

73
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Heather Meeker>And by the way, that's very
similar to what programming is

74
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.200
<v Heather Meeker>like and I love both of those
things.

75
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.399
<v Heather Meeker>So I started trying to unpack this
puzzle and figure it out.

76
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.700
<v Heather Meeker>And it's been so interesting and
sustained me for decades now in my

77
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.900
<v Heather Meeker>practice, and it's made my
practice better than I could have

78
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.500
<v Heather Meeker>ever expected.

79
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Heather Meeker>Just the pure interest value of,

80
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.000
<v Heather Meeker>it is really what gets me out of
bed and at my desk every morning,

81
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.200
<v Heather Meeker>So I have had a wonderful time
focusing on open source software

82
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Heather Meeker>licensing over the years.

83
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.200
<v Heather Meeker>Well, I hope you enjoy listening

84
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Heather Meeker>to the stories in this archive,
and I hope it helps make you think

85
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Heather Meeker>about how people can change the
world.

86
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Heather Meeker>Thanks so much for listening.
